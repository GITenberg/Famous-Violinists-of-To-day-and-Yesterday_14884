    <p>
      In "Famous Violinists" the writer has endeavoured to follow the
      same general plan as in "Famous Singers," viz., to give a
      "bird's-eye view" of the most celebrated violinists from the
      earliest times to the present day rather than a detailed account
      of a very few. Necessarily, those who have been prominently
      before the public as performers are selected in preference to
      those who have been more celebrated as teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at first intended to arrange the chapters according to
      "schools," but it soon became evident that such a plan would lead
      to inextricable confusion, and it was found best to follow the
      chronological order of birth.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page5" id="page5"></a>{5}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The "Chronological Table" is compiled from the best existing
      authorities, and is not an effort to bring together a large
      number of names. If such were the desire, there would be no
      difficulty in filling up a large volume with names of the
      violinists of good capabilities, who are well known in their own
      cities.

      INTRODUCTORY.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no instrument of music made by the hands of man that
      holds such a powerful sway over the emotions of every living
      thing capable of hearing, as the violin. The singular powers of
      this beautiful instrument have been eloquently eulogised by
      Oliver Wendell Holmes, in the following words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Violins, too. The sweet old Amati! the divine Stradivari! played
      on by ancient maestros until the bow hand lost its power, and the
      flying fingers stiffened. Bequeathed to the <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>{12}</span> passionate
      young enthusiast, who made it whisper his hidden love, and cry
      his inarticulate longings, and scream his untold agonies, and
      wail his monotonous despair. Passed from his dying hand to the
      cold virtuoso, who let it slumber in its case for a generation,
      till, when his hoard was broken up, it came forth once more, and
      rode the stormy symphonies of royal orchestras, beneath the
      rushing bow of their lord and leader. Into lonely prisons with
      improvident artists; into convents from which arose, day and
      night, the holy hymns with which its tones were blended; and back
      again to orgies, in which it learned to howl and laugh as if a
      legion of devils were shut up in it; then, again, to the gentle
      <i>dilettante</i>, who calmed it down with easy melodies until it
      answered him softly as in the days of the old maestros; and so
      given into our hands, its pores all full of music, stained like
      the meerschaum through and through <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page13" id="page13"></a>{13}</span> with the concentrated hue
      and sweetness of all the harmonies which have kindled and faded
      on its strings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such, indeed, has been the history of many a noble instrument
      fashioned years and years ago, in the days when violin playing
      did not hold the same respect and admiration that it commands at
      the present time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evolution of the violin is a matter which can be traced back
      to the dark ages, but the fifteenth century may be considered as
      the period when the art of making instruments of the viol class
      took root in Italy. It cannot be said, however, that the violin,
      with the modelled back which gives its distinctive tone, made its
      appearance until the middle of the sixteenth century. In France,
      England, and Germany, there was very little violin making until
      the beginning of the following century. Andrea Amati was born in
      1520, and he was the founder<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page14" id="page14"></a>{14}</span> of the great Cremona school
      of violin makers, of which Nicolo Amati, the grandson of Andrea,
      was the most eminent. The art of violin making reached its zenith
      in Italy at the time of Antonio Stradivari, who lived at Cremona.
      He was born in 1644, and lived until 1737, continuing his labours
      almost to the day of his death, for an instrument is in existence
      made by him in the year in which he died. It is an interesting
      fact that the art of violin making in Italy developed at the time
      when the painters of Italy displayed their greatest genius, and
      when the fine arts were encouraged by the most distinguished
      patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the art of violin making developed, so did that of violin
      playing, but, whereas the former reached its climax with
      Stradivari, the latter is still being developed, as new writers
      and players find new difficulties and new effects. While there
      are many proofs that orchestras existed, and that violins
      of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id=
      "page15"></a>{15}</span> all sizes were used in ecclesiastical
      music, there is still some doubt as to who was the first solo
      violinist of eminence. The earliest of whom we have any account
      worthy of mention, was Baltazarini, a native of Piedmont, who
      went to France in 1577 to superintend the music of Catharine de
      Medici. In 1581 he composed the music for the nuptials of the
      Duke de Joyeuse with Mlle. de Vaudemont, sister of the queen, and
      this is said to have been the origin of the heroic and historical
      ballet in France.
    </p>
    <p>
      The progress of violin playing can also be judged somewhat by the
      compositions written for the instrument. Of these the earliest
      known is a "Romanesca per violone Solo e Basso se piaci," and
      some dances, by Biagio Marini, published in 1620. This contains
      the "shake." Then there is a "Toccata" for violin solo, by Paolo
      Quagliati, published in 1623, and a collection of violin pieces
      by Carlo Farina, published in 1627 at Dresden, in<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>{16}</span> which the
      variety of bowing, double stopping, and chords shows a great
      advance in the demands upon the execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farina held the position of solo violinist at the Court of
      Saxony, and has been called the founder of the race of violin
      virtuosi. One of his compositions, named "Cappriccio
      Stravagante," requires the instrument to imitate the braying of
      an ass, and other sounds belonging to the animal kingdom, as well
      as the twanging of guitars and the fife and drum of the soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eighteen sonatas composed by Giovanni Battista Fontana, and
      published at Venice in 1641, show a distinct advance in style,
      and Tomasso Antonio Vitali, himself a famous violinist, wrote a
      "Chaconne" of such merit that it was played by no less a virtuoso
      than Joachim, at the Monday popular concerts in London, in 1870,
      nearly two hundred years after its composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Italy was the home of the violin, of composition<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>{17}</span> for the
      violin, and of violin playing, for the first school was the old
      Italian school, and from Italy, by means of her celebrated
      violinists, who travelled and spread throughout Europe, the other
      schools were established.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violin playing grew in favour in Italy, France, Germany, and
      England at about the same time, but in England it was many years
      before the violinist held a position of any dignity. The fiddle,
      as it was called, was regarded by the gentry with profound
      contempt. Butler, in "Hudibras," refers to one Jackson, who lost
      a leg in the service of the Roundheads, and became a professional
      "fiddler:"

      In the course of time the English learned to esteem all arts more
      highly, and in no country was a great musician more sure of a
      warm welcome.

    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>{19}</span>
    <p>
      Two celebrated violinists were born in the year 1630, Thomas
      Baltzar, and John Banister, the former in Germany, at Lubec, and
      the latter in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baltzar was esteemed the finest performer of his time, and is
      said to have been the first to have introduced the practice of
      "shifting." In 1656 Baltzar went to England, where he quite
      eclipsed Davis Mell, a clockmaker, who was considered a fine
      player, and did much to give the violin an impetus toward
      popularity. The wonder caused by his performances in England,
      shortly after his arrival, is best described in the quaint
      language of Anthony Wood, who "did, to his very great
      astonishment, hear him play on the violin. He then saw him run up
      his Fingers to the end of the Fingerboard of the Violin, and run
      them back insensibly, and all with alacrity, and in very good
      tune,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id=
      "page20"></a>{20}</span> which he nor any in England saw the like
      before."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Restoration Baltzar was appointed leader of the king's
      celebrated band of twenty-four violins, but, sad to relate,
      "Being much admired by all lovers of musick, his company was
      therefore desired; and company, especially musical company,
      delighting in drinking, made him drink more than ordinary, which
      brought him to his grave." And he was buried in the cloister of
      Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Banister was taught music by his father, one of the
      <i>waits</i> of the parish of St. Giles, and acquiring great
      proficiency on the violin was noticed by King Charles II., who
      sent him to France for improvement. On his return he was
      appointed chief of the king's violins. King Charles was an
      admirer of everything French, and he appears, according to Pepys,
      to have aroused the wrath of Banister by giving prominence to a
      French fiddler named Grabu,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"
      id="page21"></a>{21}</span> who is said to have been an "impudent
      pretender." Banister lost his place for saying, either to or in
      the hearing of the king, that English performers on the violin
      were superior to those of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Banister lived in times when fiddle playing was not highly
      esteemed, if we may judge by the following ordinance, made in
      1658: "And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, that
      if any person or persons, commonly called Fiddlers, or minstrels,
      shall at any time after the said first day of July be taken
      playing, Fiddling, or making music in any inn, alehouse, or
      tavern or shall be proffering themselves, or desiring, or
      entreating any person or persons to hear them play ... shall be
      adjudged ... rogues, vagabonds, and sturdy beggars."
    </p>
    <p>
      John Banister seems to have been a somewhat "sturdy beggar,"
      though not exactly in the sense meant by the ordinance, for
      he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id=
      "page22"></a>{22}</span> established regular concerts at his
      house, "now called the Musick-school, over against the George
      Tavern in Whitefriars." These concerts began in 1672, and
      continued till near his death, which occurred in 1679. He too,
      was buried in the cloister of Westminster Abbey. His son, also,
      was an excellent performer on the violin, and played first violin
      in the Italian opera when it was first introduced into England.
      He was one of the musicians of Charles II., James II., William
      and Mary, and of Queen Anne.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Eccles, who lived about the end of the seventeenth century,
      went to France, where he became a member of the king's band, and
      William Corbett, who went to Italy to study the violin in 1710,
      was a player of much ability; but one of the most eminent of
      English violinists was Matthew Dubourg, born 1703, who played at
      a concert when he was so small that he was placed on a stool in
      order that he might be seen. At eleven<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>{23}</span> years of
      age he was placed under Geminiani, who had recently established
      himself in London. Dubourg was appointed, in 1728, Master and
      Composer of State-Music in Ireland, and on the death of Festing,
      in 1752, he became leader of the king's band in London, and held
      both posts until his death in 1767.
    </p>
    <p>
      An amusing incident is related of Dubourg and Handel. The latter
      visited Dublin and presided at a performance of the "Messiah." A
      few evenings later, Dubourg, who was leader of the band at the
      Theatre, had to improvise a "close," and wandered about in a fit
      of abstract modulation for so long that he forgot the original
      key. At last, however, after a protracted shake, he landed safely
      on the key-note, when Handel called out in a voice loud enough to
      be heard in the remotest parts of the theatre, "Welcome home,
      welcome home, Mr. Dubourg."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dubourg's name is the first on record in<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>{24}</span> connection
      with the performance of a concerto in an English theatre.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Clegg, a pupil of Dubourg, was a violinist of great ability,
      whom Handel placed at the head of the opera band, but his
      faculties became deranged by intense study and practice, and he
      died at a comparatively early age, in 1742, an inmate of Bedlam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another very promising young English violinist was Thomas Linley,
      who exhibited great musical powers, and performed a concerto in
      public when eight years old. He was sent to Italy to study under
      Nardini, and through the mediation of that artist he became
      acquainted with Mozart, who was about the same age. Linley's
      career was prematurely closed, for at the age of twenty-two he
      was drowned through the capsizing of a pleasure-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This completes the list of English violinists of note who were
      born previous to the nineteenth century. The later ones we
      shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id=
      "page25"></a>{25}</span> find in their place in succeeding
      chapters, but there have been very few violinists of English
      birth who have followed the career of the "virtuoso." Even
      Antonio James Oury, who made a series of concert tours lasting
      nine years, during which he occasionally appeared in conjunction
      with De Bériot and Malibran, is hardly known as a "virtuoso," and
      was not all English. But there are pathetic circumstances in
      regard to the career of Oury. He was the son of an Italian of
      noble descent, who had served as an officer in the army of
      Napoleon, and had been taken prisoner by the English. Making the
      best of his misfortunes the elder Oury settled in England,
      married a Miss Hughes, and became a professor of dancing and
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The son, Antonio, began to learn the violin at the age of three,
      in which he was a year or two ahead of the average virtuoso, and
      he made great progress. By and by he<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>{26}</span> heard
      Spohr, and after that his diligence increased, for he practised,
      during seven months, not less than fourteen hours a day. Even
      Paganini used to sink exhausted after ten hours' practice. In
      1820, we are told, he went to Paris and studied under Baillot,
      Kreutzer, and Lafont, receiving from each two lessons a week for
      several successive winters. With such an imposing array of talent
      at his service much might be expected of Mr. Oury, and he
      actually made his début at the Philharmonic concerts in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another unfortunate officer of Napoleon who became
      tutor to the Princesses of Bavaria. His name was Belleville. Mr.
      Oury met his daughter, and, there being naturally a bond of
      sympathy between them, they married. She was an amiable and
      accomplished pianist, and together they made the nine years'
      concert tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the period in which the art of violin playing was being
      perfected on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id=
      "page27"></a>{27}</span> Continent, the English were too fully
      occupied with commercial pursuits to foster and develop the art.
      Up to the present day the most eminent virtuoso is commonly
      spoken of as a "fiddler." Even Joachim, when he went to a
      barber's shop in High Street, Kensington, and declined to accept
      the advice of the tonsorial artist, and have his hair cropped
      short, was warned that "he'd look like one o' them there fiddler
      chaps." The barber apparently had no greater estimation of the
      violinist's art than the latter had of the tonsorial profession,
      and the situation was sufficiently ludicrous to form the subject
      of a picture in <i>Punch</i>, and thus the matter assumed a
      serious aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      England has not been the home of any particular school of violin
      playing, but has received her stimulus from Continental schools,
      to which her sons have gone to study, and from which many eminent
      violinists have been imported.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page28" id="page28"></a>{28}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The word "school," so frequently used in connection with the art
      of violin playing, seems to lead to confusion. The Italian
      school, established by Corelli, appears to have been the only
      original school. Its pupils scattered to various parts of Europe,
      and there established other schools. To illustrate this
      statement, we will follow in a direct line from Corelli,
      according to the table given in Grove's Dictionary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pupils of Corelli were Somis, Locatelli, Geminiani
      (Italians), and Anêt (a Frenchman), whose pupil Senaillé was also
      French. The greatest pupil of Somis was Pugnani, an Italian, and
      his greatest pupil was Viotti, a Piedmontese, who founded the
      French school, and from him came Roberrechts, his pupil De Bériot
      and his pupil Vieuxtemps, the two latter Belgians, also Baillot,
      etc., down to Marsick and Sarasate, a Spaniard, while through
      Rode, a Frenchman, we have Böhm (school of Vienna)<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>{29}</span> and his
      pupil Joachim, a Hungarian (school of Berlin).
    </p>
    <p>
      Several violinists are found under two schools, as for instance,
      Pugnani, who was first a pupil of Tartini and later of Somis, and
      Teresa Milanollo, pupil of Lafont and of De Bériot, who appear
      under different schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only conclusion to be drawn is that the greatest violinists
      were really independent of any school, and, by their own genius,
      broke loose from tradition and established schools of their own.
      Some of them, on the other hand, had but few pupils, as for
      instance, Paganini, who had but two, and Sarasate. Many also were
      teachers rather than performers. We have to deal chiefly with the
      virtuosi.

    <p>
      1650 TO 1750.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arcangelo Corelli, whose name is recognised as one of the
      greatest in the history of violin playing and composition, and
      who laid the foundation for all future development of technique,
      was born in 1653, at Fusignano, near Imola, in the territory of
      Bologna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He showed an early propensity for the violin, and studied under
      Bassani, a man of extensive knowledge and capabilities, while
      Mattei Simonelli was his instructor in counterpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corelli at one time sought fame away from home, and he is said to
      have visited Paris, where Lulli, the chief violinist of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id=
      "page31"></a>{31}</span> that city, exhibited such jealousy and
      violence that the mild-tempered Corelli withdrew. In 1680 he went
      to Germany, where he was well received, and entered the service
      of the Elector of Bavaria, but he soon returned to Rome. His
      proficiency had now become so great that his fame extended
      throughout Europe, and pupils flocked to him. His playing was
      characterised by refined taste and elegance, and by a firm and
      even tone.

        <b>ARCHANGE CORELLI</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      When the opera was well established in Rome, about 1690, Corelli
      led the band. His chief patron in Rome was Cardinal Ottoboni, and
      it was at his house that an incident occurred which places
      Corelli at the head of those musicians who have from time to time
      boldly maintained the rights of music against conversation. He
      was playing a solo when he noticed the cardinal engaged in
      conversation with another person. He immediately laid down his
      violin, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id=
      "page32"></a>{32}</span> on being asked the reason, answered that
      "he feared the music might interrupt the conversation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Corelli was a man of gentle disposition and simple habits. His
      plainness of dress and freedom from ostentation gave the
      impression that he was parsimonious, and Handel says of him that
      "he liked nothing better than seeing pictures without paying for
      it, and saving money," He was also noted for his objection to
      riding in carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived on terms of intimacy with the leading artists of his
      time, and had a great fondness for pictures, of which he had a
      valuable collection. These he left at his death to Cardinal
      Ottoboni.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at Cardinal Ottoboni's that Corelli became acquainted with
      Handel, and at one of the musical evenings there a "Serenata,"
      written by the latter, was performed. Corelli does not seem to
      have played it according to the ideas of the composer, for
      Handel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id=
      "page33"></a>{33}</span> giving way to his impetuous temper,
      snatched the fiddle out of Correlli's hand. Corelli mildly
      remarked, "My dear Saxon, this music is in the French style, with
      which I am not acquainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years Corelli remained at Rome, but at last he yielded
      to temptation and went to Naples, where Scarlatti induced him to
      play some of his concertos before the king. This he did in great
      fear, for he had not his own orchestra with him. He found
      Scarlatti's musicians able to play at first sight as well as his
      own did after rehearsals, and, the performance going off well, he
      was again admitted to play, this time one of his sonatas, in the
      royal presence. The king found the adagio so long and dry that he
      quitted the room, much to Corelli's mortification. But greater
      trouble was in store for the virtuoso. Scarlatti had written a
      masque, which was to be played before the king, but owing to the
      composer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id=
      "page34"></a>{34}</span> limited knowledge of the violin,
      Corelli's part was very awkward and difficult, and he failed to
      execute it, while the Neapolitan violinists played it with ease.
      To make matters worse, Corelli made an unfortunate mistake in the
      next piece, which was written in the key of C minor, and led off
      in C major. The mistake was repeated, and Scarlatti had to call
      out to him to set him right. His mortification was so great that
      he quietly left Naples and returned to Rome. He found here a new
      violinist, Valentini, who had won the admiration of the people,
      and he took it so much to heart that his health failed, and he
      died in January, 1713.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corelli was buried in princely style in the Pantheon, not far
      from Raphael's tomb, and Cardinal Ottoboni erected a monument
      over his grave. During many years after his death a solemn
      service, consisting of selections from his own works, was
      performed in the Pantheon on the anniversary of his<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>{35}</span> funeral.
      On this occasion, the works were performed in a slow, firm, and
      distinct manner, just as they were written, without changing the
      passages in the way of embellishment, and this is probably the
      way in which he himself played them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corelli's compositions are remarkable for delicate taste and
      pleasing melodies and harmonies. He must be considered as the
      author of the greatest improvement which violin music underwent
      at the beginning of the eighteenth century. These compositions
      are regarded as invaluable for the instruction of young players,
      and some of them may be frequently heard in the concert-room at
      the present day, two hundred years since they were written.
      Corelli's most celebrated pupils, Somis, Locatelli, Geminiani,
      and Anêt, settled respectively in Italy, Holland, England, and
      Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giovanni Battista Somis was born in Piedmont, and, after studying
      under Corelli, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id=
      "page36"></a>{36}</span> went to Venice and studied under
      Vivaldi. He was appointed solo violinist to the king at Turin and
      leader of the royal band, and seems scarcely ever to have left
      Turin after these appointments. Little is known of his playing or
      his compositions, but, by the work of his pupils, it is evident
      that he possessed originality. He formed a style more brilliant
      and more emotional, and caused a decided step forward in the art
      of violin playing. He was the teacher of Leclair, Giardini, and
      Chiabran, as well as Pugnani, and he forms a connecting link
      between the classical schools of Italy and France.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pietro Locatelli was born at Bergamo, and became a pupil of
      Corelli at a very early age. He travelled considerably, and was
      undoubtedly a great and original virtuoso. He has been accused of
      charlatanism, inasmuch as he overstepped all reasonable limits in
      his endeavours to enlarge the powers of execution of the violin,
      and has, on that account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"
      id="page37"></a>{37}</span> been called the grandfather of our
      modern "finger-heroes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Locatelli settled in Amsterdam, where he died in 1764. There he
      established regular public concerts, and he left a number of
      compositions, some of which are used at the present day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Baptiste Lulli, one of the earliest violinists in France, is
      perhaps associated with the violin in a manner disproportionate
      to the part he actually played in its progress. He was a musician
      of great ability, and his compositions are occasionally heard
      even to this day. Lulli was born near Florence about 1633. When
      quite young he was taken to France by the Chevalier de Guise, and
      entered the service of Mlle. de Montpensier. He was employed in
      the kitchen, where he seems to have lightened his burdens by
      playing tricks on the cook and tunes on the stewpans. He also
      beguiled his leisure hours by playing the violin, in which art he
      made<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id=
      "page38"></a>{38}</span> such progress that the princess engaged
      a regular instructor for him. Fortunately, as it turned out, his
      wit led him into composing a satirical song on his employer, and
      he was sent off, but shortly afterwards secured a post as one of
      the king's violinists in the celebrated band of the twenty-four
      violins. Soon after this a special band called <i>Les Petits
      Violons</i> was formed with Lulli at their head, and under his
      direction it surpassed the band of twenty-four.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lulli found great favour at court, and, indeed, astonished the
      world with his exquisite taste and skill. That he was firmly
      established in the favour of the king is shown by the story that,
      when Corelli came to France and played one of his sonatas, King
      Louis listened without showing any sign of pleasure, and, sending
      for one of his own violinists, requested him to play an aria from
      Lulli's opera of "Cadmus et Hermione," which, he declared, suited
      his taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id=
      "page39"></a>{39}</span> There is little doubt that the
      principles of the great Italian school of violin playing were,
      some years later, brought into France by Anêt, who was born in
      1680, and returned from Italy about 1700, but owing to the
      jealousies of his colleagues, he found it advisable to leave
      France in a short time, and he is said to have spent the rest of
      his life as conductor of the private band of a nobleman in
      Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lulli is said to have been very avaricious, and his wealth
      included four houses, all in the best quarters of Paris, together
      with securities and appointments worth about $70,000. His death,
      in 1687, was caused by a peculiar accident. While conducting a
      performance of his orchestra he struck his foot with the cane
      which he used for marking the time. The bruise gradually assumed
      such a serious condition that it ended his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Baptiste Senaillé, who was a pupil of<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>{40}</span> Anêt, was
      born in 1687, and turned to the Italian school. In 1719 he
      entered the service of the Duke of Orleans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Francesco Geminiani was considered the ablest of the pupils of
      Corelli, and was born about 1680. When about twenty-four years of
      age he went to England, where his talent secured a great
      reputation for him, some people even declaring him to be
      superior, as a player, to Corelli. He lived to an advanced age,
      and was in Dublin visiting his pupil Dubourg at the time of his
      death. He was a man of unsettled habits, and was frequently in
      dire necessity, caused chiefly by his love of pictures, which led
      him into unwise purchases, and thus frequently into debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the year 1650 three violinists were born in Italy, who all
      left their mark upon the history of violin playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tommaso Vitali was born at Bologna, and was leader of the
      orchestra in that city, and later in Modena.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id=
      "page41"></a>{41}</span> Giuseppe Torelli was leader of a church
      orchestra in Bologna, and afterwards accepted the post of leader
      of the band of the Markgraf of Brandenburg-Anspach, at Anspach,
      in Germany. To him is generally ascribed the invention of the
      "Concerto."
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonio Vivaldi was the son of a violinist, and sought his
      fortune in Germany, but returned to his native city in 1713. He
      wrote extensively for the violin, and is said to have added
      something to the development of its technique. An anecdote is
      told of him to the effect that one day during mass a theme for a
      fugue struck him. He immediately quitted the altar at which he
      was officiating, for he united clerical with musical duties, and,
      hastening to the sacristy to write down the theme, afterwards
      returned and finished the mass. For this he was brought before
      the Inquisition, but being considered only as a "musician," a
      term synonymous with "madman," the sentence was
      mild,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id=
      "page42"></a>{42}</span> he was forbidden to say mass in the
      future.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most illustrious pupil of Vivaldi was Francesco Maria
      Veracini, who was born about 1685. He is said to have been a
      teacher of Tartini, who, if he did not actually receive
      instruction from him, at least profited by his example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veracini's travels were extensive, for he visited London in 1714
      and remained there two years, during which time he was very
      successful. He then went to Dresden, where he was made composer
      and chamber virtuoso to the King of Poland.
    </p>
    <p>
      While in Dresden he threw himself out of a window and broke his
      leg, an injury from which he never entirely recovered. This act
      is said to have been caused by his mortification at a trick which
      was played upon him for his humiliation by Pisendel, an eminent
      violinist, but this story is discredited by some of the best
      authorities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id=
      "page43"></a>{43}</span> He left Dresden and went to Prague,
      where he entered the service of Count Kinsky. In 1736 he again
      visited London, but met with little success, owing to the fact
      that Geminiani had ingratiated himself with the public. In 1847
      Veracini returned to Pisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veracini has been sometimes ranked with Tartini as a performer.
      He was also a composer of ability. In making a comparison of him
      with Geminiani it has been said that Geminiani was the spirit of
      Corelli much diluted, while Veracini was the essence of the great
      master fortified with <i>l'eau de vie</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Veracini was conceited and vainglorious, and these traits of his
      character have given rise to a number of rather inconsequential
      stories. He was a most excellent conductor of orchestra, and
      Doctor Burney mentions having heard him lead a band in such a
      bold and masterly manner as he had never before witnessed. Soon
      after leaving London Veracini was shipwrecked, and lost his two
      Stainer <span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id=
      "page44"></a>{44}</span> violins, which he stated were the best
      in the world. These instruments he named St. Peter and St. Paul.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Giuseppe Tartini will ever live as that of one of the
      greatest performers on, and composers for, the violin. Born at
      Pirano, in 1692, his career may be said to have commenced with
      the eighteenth century. He was not only one of the greatest
      violinists of all time, and an eminent composer, but he was a
      scientific writer on musical physics, and was the first to
      discover the fact that, in playing double stops, their accuracy
      can be determined by the production of a third sound. He also
      wrote a little work on the execution and employment of the
      various kinds of shakes, mordents, cadenzas, etc., according to
      the usage of the classical Italian school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tartini's father, who was an elected Nobile of Parenzo, being a
      pious Church benefactor, intended his son for the Church,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id=
      "page45"></a>{45}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of this marriage caused Tartini's parents to withdraw
      their support from him, and it so enraged the archbishop that the
      bridegroom was obliged to fly from Padua. After some wanderings
      he was received into a monastery at Assisi, of which a relative
      was an inmate. Here he resumed his mu<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>{46}</span> sical
      studies, but though he learned composition of Padre Boemo, the
      organist of the monastery, he was his own teacher on the violin.
      The influence of the quiet monastic life caused a complete change
      in his character, and he acquired the modesty of manner and
      serenity of mind for which he was noted later in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, during the service, a gust of wind blew aside the
      curtain behind which Tartini was playing, and a Paduan, who
      remembered the archbishop's wrath and recognised the object of
      it, carried the news of his discovery to the worthy prelate. Time
      had, however, mollified him, and instead of still further
      persecuting the refugee, he gave his consent to the union of the
      young couple, and Tartini and his wife went to Venice, where he
      intended to follow the profession of a violinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he met and heard Francesco Maria Veracini, who was some
      seven years his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id=
      "page47"></a>{47}</span> senior, and whose style of playing made
      such a deep impression on him that he at once withdrew to Ancona,
      to correct the errors of his own technique, which, as he was
      self-taught, were not a few.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some years of study and retirement, he reappeared at Padua,
      where he was appointed solo violinist in the chapel of San
      Antonio, the choir and orchestra of which already enjoyed a high
      reputation. It is said that the performance of Veracini had an
      effect upon Tartini beyond that of causing him to quit Venice. It
      made him dream, and the dream as told by Tartini himself to M. de
      Lalande is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He dreamed one night (in 1713) that he had made a compact with
      the devil, who promised to be at his service on all occasions;
      and, during this vision, everything succeeded according to his
      mind; his wishes were anticipated, and his desires always
      surpassed, by the assistance of his new servant.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>{48}</span> In short,
      he imagined that he presented the devil with his violin, in order
      to discover what kind of a musician he was, when, to his great
      astonishment, he heard him play a solo so singularly beautiful,
      which he executed with such superior taste and precision, that it
      surpassed all the music he had ever heard or conceived in his
      life. So great was his surprise, and so exquisite his delight
      upon this occasion, that it deprived him of the power of
      breathing. He awoke with the violence of his sensations, and
      instantly seized his fiddle in hopes of expressing what he had
      just heard; but in vain. He, however, directly composed a piece,
      which is perhaps the best of all his works, and called it the
      'Devil's Sonata;' he knew it, however, to be so inferior to what
      his sleep had produced, that he stated he would have broken his
      instrument, and abandoned music for ever, if he could have
      subsisted by other means."<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49"
      id="page49"></a>{49}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      This composition is said to have secured for him the position in
      the chapel of San Antonio, where he remained until 1723, in which
      year he was invited to play at the coronation festivities of
      Charles VI. at Prague. On this occasion he met Count Kinsky, a
      rich and enthusiastic amateur, who kept an excellent private
      orchestra. Tartini was engaged as conductor and remained in that
      position three years, then returning to his old post at Padua,
      from which nothing induced him to part, except for brief
      intervals. At Padua Tartini carried on the chief work of his life
      and established the Paduan school of violin playing. His ability
      as a teacher is proved by the large number of excellent pupils he
      formed. Nardini, Bini, Manfredi, Ferrari, Graun, and Lahoussaye
      are among the most eminent, and were attached to him by bonds of
      most intimate friendship to his life's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tartini's contemporaries all agree in credit<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>{50}</span> ing him
      with those qualities which make a great player. He had a fine
      tone, unlimited command of finger-board and bow, enabling him to
      overcome the greatest difficulties with remarkable ease, perfect
      intonation in double stops, and a most brilliant shake and
      double-shake, which he executed equally well with all fingers.
      The spirit of rivalry had no place in his amiable and gentle
      disposition. Both as a player and composer Tartini was the true
      successor of Corelli, representing in both respects the next step
      in the development of the art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tartini lived until the year 1770. He had, as Doctor Burney says,
      "no other children than his scholars, of whom his care was
      constantly paternal," Nardini, his first and favourite pupil,
      came from Leghorn to see him in his sickness and attend him in
      his last moments with true filial affection and tenderness. He
      was buried in the Church of St. Catharine, a solemn requiem
      being<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id=
      "page51"></a>{51}</span> held in the chapel of San Antonio, and
      at a later period his memory was honoured by a statue which was
      erected in the Prato della Valle, a public walk at Padua, where
      it may be seen among the statues of the most eminent men
      connected with that famous university.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Marie Leclair, a pupil of Somis, was a Frenchman, born at
      Lyons, and he began life as a dancer at the Rouen Theatre. He
      went to Turin as ballet master and met Somis, who induced him to
      take up the violin and apply himself to serious study. On
      returning to Paris, he was appointed ripieno-violinist at the
      Opéra, and in 1731 became a member of the royal band, but he,
      although undoubtedly superior to any violinist in Paris at that
      time, never seems to have made much of a success, for he resigned
      his positions and occupied himself exclusively with teaching and
      composition, and it is on the merits of<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>{52}</span> his works
      that he occupies a high place among the great classical masters
      of the violin. Leclair was murdered late one night close to the
      door of his own house, shortly after his return from Amsterdam,
      to which place he had gone solely for the purpose of hearing
      Locatelli. No motive for the crime was ever discovered, nor was
      the murderer found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gaetano Pugnani was a native of Turin, and to him more than to
      any other master is due the preservation of the pure, grand style
      of Corelli, Tartini, and Vivaldi, for he combined the prominent
      qualities of style and technique of all three. He became first
      violin to the Sardinian court in 1752, but travelled extensively.
      He made long stays in Paris and London, where he was for a time
      leader of the opera band, and produced an opera of his own, also
      publishing a number of his compositions. In 1770 he was at Turin,
      where he remained to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"
      id="page53"></a>{53}</span> end of his life as teacher,
      conductor, and composer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Felice Giardini, another pupil of Somis, was born at Turin and
      became one of the foremost violinists in Europe. In 1750 he went
      to England where he made his first appearance at a benefit
      concert for Cuzzoni, the celebrated opera singer, then in the
      sere and yellow leaf of her career. His performance was so
      brilliant that he became established as the best violinist who
      had yet appeared in England, and in 1754 he was placed at the
      head of the opera orchestra, succeeding Festing. Soon afterwards
      he joined with the singer Mingotti in the management of opera,
      but the attempt was not a financial success. Notwithstanding his
      excellence as a performer and composer and the fine appointment
      which he held, Giardini died in abject poverty at Moscow, to
      which place he had gone after finding himself superseded in
      England by newcomers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id=
      "page54"></a>{54}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the pupils of Tartini the most eminent was Pietro Nardini,
      who was born at Fibiano, a village of Tuscany, in 1722. He became
      solo violinist at the court of Stuttgart and remained there
      fifteen years. In 1767 he went to Leghorn for a short time, and
      then returned to Padua, where he remained with his old master
      Tartini until the latter's death, when he was appointed director
      of music to the court of the Duke of Tuscany, in whose service he
      remained many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his playing, Leopold Mozart, himself an eminent violinist,
      writes: "The beauty, purity and equality of his tone, and the
      tastefulness of his cantabile playing, cannot be surpassed; but
      he does not execute great difficulties." His compositions are
      marked by vivacity, grace, and sweet sentimentality, but he has
      neither the depth of feeling, the grand pathos, nor the
      concentrated energy of his master Tartini.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>{55}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Antonio Lolli, who was born at Bergamo about 1730, appears to
      have been somewhat of a charlatan. He was self-taught, and,
      though a performer of a good deal of brilliancy, was but a poor
      musician. He was restless, vain, and conceited, and addicted to
      gambling. He is said to have played the most difficult
      double-stops, octaves, tenths, double-shakes in thirds and
      sixths, harmonics, etc., with the greatest ease and certainty. At
      one time he appeared as a rival of Nardini, with whom he is said
      to have had a contest, and whom he is supposed to have defeated.
      According to some accounts, he managed to excite such universal
      admiration in advance of the contest that Nardini withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lolli was so eccentric that he was considered by many people to
      be insane, and Doctor Burney, in writing of him, says, "I am
      convinced that in his lucid intervals, he was in a serious style
      a very great,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id=
      "page56"></a>{56}</span> expressive, and admirable performer;"
      but Doctor Burney does not mention any lucid interval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the eighteenth century Franz Benda was born in Bohemia
      at the village of Altbenatky, and Benda became the founder of a
      German school of violin playing. In his youth he was a chorister
      at Prague and afterward in the Chapel Royal at Dresden. At the
      same time he began to study the violin, and soon joined a company
      of strolling musicians who attended fêtes, fairs, etc. At
      eighteen years of age Benda abandoned this wandering life and
      returned to Prague, going thence to Vienna, where he pursued his
      study of the violin under Graun, a pupil of Tartini. After two
      years he was appointed chapel master at Warsaw, and eventually he
      became a member of the Prince Royal of Prussia's band, and then
      concert master to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      Benda was a master of all the difficulties<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>{57}</span> of violin
      playing, and the rapidity of his execution and the mellow
      sweetness of his highest notes were unequalled. He had many
      pupils and wrote a number of works, chiefly exercises and studies
      for the violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A violinist whose career had a great influence on musical life in
      England was Johann Peter Salomon, a pupil of Benda, and it is
      necessary to speak of him because his name is so frequently
      mentioned in connection with other artists during the latter half
      of the eighteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Salomon was born at Bonn in the same house in which Beethoven was
      born, and of Salomon, after his death, Beethoven wrote:
      "Salomon's death grieves me much, for he was a noble man, and I
      remember him ever since I was a child."
    </p>
    <p>
      Salomon became an expert violinist at an early age, and travelled
      a good deal in Europe before he settled in England, which was in
      1781, when he made his appearance at<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>{58}</span> Covent
      Garden Theatre. He was criticised thus: "He does not play in the
      most graceful style, it must be confessed, but his tone and
      execution are such as cannot fail to secure him a number of
      admirers in the musical world."
    </p>
    <p>
      He established a series of subscription concerts at the Hanover
      Square rooms, and produced symphonies of Mozart and Haydn. In
      fact, he was connected with almost every celebrity who appeared
      in England for many years. He was instrumental in bringing Haydn
      to England, and toward the end of his career he was actively
      interested in the foundation of the Philharmonic Society. He was
      noted more as a quartet player than as a soloist, and Haydn's
      last quartets were composed especially to suit his style of
      playing. He was a man of much cultivation and moved in
      distinguished society. His death was caused by a fall from his
      horse. He was the possessor of a Stradivarius violin<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>{59}</span> which was
      said to have belonged to Corelli and to have had his name upon
      it. This he bequeathed to Sir Patrick Blake of Bury St. Edmunds.

      1750 TO 1800.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giovanni Baptiste Viotti has been called the last great
      representative of the classical Italian school, and it is also
      stated that with Viotti began the modern school of the violin. In
      whatever light he may be regarded, he was undoubtedly one of the
      greatest violinists of all. He retained in his style of playing
      and composing the dignified simplicity and noble pathos of the
      great masters of the Italian school, treating his instrument
      above all as a singing voice, and keeping strictly within its
      natural resources. According to Baillot, one of his most
      distinguished pupils, his style was "perfection," a word which
      covers a host of virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id=
      "page61"></a>{61}</span> Viotti was born in 1753 at Fontanetto, a
      village in Piedmont. His first musical instruction was received
      from his father, who is severally mentioned as a blacksmith and
      as a horn player. His musical talent being early noticeable, he
      was sent to Turin and placed by Prince Pozzo de la Cisterna under
      the tutelage of Pugnani, and was soon received into the royal
      band. In 1780 he travelled extensively, visiting Germany, Poland,
      and Russia, and meeting with great success. The Empress Catharine
      endeavoured to induce him to remain at St. Petersburg, but
      without success, and he proceeded to London, where he soon
      eclipsed all other violinists. In 1782 he went to Paris and made
      his début at the celebrated Concert Spirituels. He was at once
      acknowledged as the greatest living violinist, but soon after
      this he ceased altogether to play in public. This decision seems
      to have been caused by the fact that an inferior player once
      achieved<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id=
      "page62"></a>{62}</span> a greater success than he. He was
      evidently of a sensitive nature, and there is an anecdote told of
      him which is amusing even if its authenticity is open to
      question. Viotti was commanded to play a concerto at the Court of
      Louis XVI., at Versailles, and had proceeded through about half
      of his performance, when the attention of the audience was
      diverted by the arrival of a distinguished guest. Noise and
      confusion reigned where silence should have been observed, and
      Viotti, in a fit of indignation, removed the music from the desk
      and left the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1783 Viotti returned to Italy for a short time, but the
      following year he was back in Paris teaching, composing, and
      benefiting the art of music in every way except by public
      performance. He became the artistic manager of the Italian Opera,
      and brought together a brilliant number of singers. In this
      business he came in contact with Cherubini, the composer, with
      whom he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id=
      "page63"></a>{63}</span> on great terms of friendship. This
      enterprise was suddenly stopped by the revolution, and Viotti was
      obliged to leave France, having lost almost everything that he
      possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to London and renewed his former successes, playing again
      in public at Salomon's concerts, and in the drawing-rooms of the
      aristocracy. But here his ill-luck followed him, for London being
      full of French refugees, and the officials being suspicious of
      them all, he was warned to leave England, as it was feared that
      he was connected with some political conspiracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      This misfortune occurred in 1798, and Viotti retired to a small
      village called Schoenfeld, not far from Hamburg, where he lived
      in strict seclusion. During this time he was by no means idle,
      for he composed some of his finest works, notably the six duets
      for violins, which he prefaced by these words: "This book is the
      fruit of leisure afforded me<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page64" id="page64"></a>{64}</span> by misfortune. Some of the
      pieces were dictated by trouble, others by hope." It was also
      during this period of retirement that he perfected his pupil
      Pixis, who, with his father, lived at Schoenfeld a whole summer
      for the express purpose of receiving Viotti's instruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1801 Viotti found himself at liberty to visit England once
      more, but when he returned he astonished the world by going into
      the wine business, in which he succeeded in getting rid of the
      remainder of his fortune. As a man of business the strictest
      integrity and honour regulated his transactions, and his feelings
      were kind and benevolent, whilst as a musician, he is said never
      to have been surpassed in any of the highest qualities of violin
      playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of his career as a wine merchant, he returned to
      Paris to resume his regular profession, and was appointed
      director of the Grand Opéra, but he failed to rescue<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>{65}</span> the opera
      from its state of decadence, and, finding the duties too arduous
      for one of his age and state of health, he retired on a small
      pension. In 1822 he returned once more to England, where he
      passed the remainder of his life in quietude.
    </p>
    <p>
      While travelling in Switzerland, and enjoying the beauties of the
      scenery, Viotti heard for the first time the plaintive notes of
      the Ranz des Vaches given forth by a mountain horn, and this
      melody so impressed him that he learned it and frequently played
      it on his violin. The subject was referred to by him with great
      enthusiasm in his letters to his friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are numerous anecdotes about Viotti in reference to his
      ready repartee and to his generous nature. One of the most
      interesting is that concerning a tin violin. He had been
      strolling one evening on the Champs Elysées, in Paris, with a
      friend (Langlé), when his attention was arrested by some
      harsh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id=
      "page66"></a>{66}</span> discordant sounds, which, on
      investigation, proved to be the tones of a tin fiddle, played by
      a blind and aged street musician. Viotti offered the man twenty
      francs for the curious instrument, which had been made by the old
      man's nephew, who was a tinker. Viotti took the instrument and
      played upon it, producing some most remarkable effects. The
      performance drew a small crowd, and Langlé, with true instinct,
      took the old man's hat and, passing it round, collected a
      respectable sum, which was handed to the aged beggar.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Viotti got out his purse to give the twenty francs the old
      man thought better of his bargain, for, said he, "I did not know
      the violin was so good. I ought to have at least double the
      amount for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Viotti, pleased with the implied compliment, did not hesitate to
      give the forty francs, and then walked off with his newly
      acquired curiosity. The nephew, however, who now arrived to take
      the old man home, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id=
      "page67"></a>{67}</span> hearing the story ran after Viotti, and
      offered to supply him with as many as he would like for six
      francs apiece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violin literature owes much to Viotti, for his compositions are
      numerous and contain beauties that have never been surpassed. His
      advice was sought by many young musicians, and among these was
      Rossini, who was destined to become great. De Bériot also sought
      out Viotti and played before him, but the old violinist told him
      that he had already acquired an original style which only
      required cultivating to lead to success, and that he could do
      nothing for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viotti was one of the first to use the Tourte bow, and he studied
      its effects closely, so that the sweep of his bow became his
      great characteristic, and was alike the admiration of his friends
      and the despair of his rivals. He died in 1824, after about two
      years of retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among Viotti's most prominent pupils<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>{68}</span> were
      Roberrechts, Pixis, Alday le jeune, Cartier, Rode, Mori, Durand,
      and Baillot, also Mlle. Gerbini and Madame Paravicini.
      Roberrechts became the teacher of De Bériot, who in turn taught
      Vieuxtemps, Teresa Milanollo, and Lauterbach. Baillot taught
      Habeneck, who taught Alard, Léonard, Prume, Cuvillon, and Mazas.
      From Alard we have Sarasate, and from Léonard, Marsick and
      Dengremont, while through Rode we have Böhm, and from him a large
      number of eminent violinists, including G. Hellmesberger, Ernst,
      Dont, Singer, L. Strauss, Joachim, Rappoldi. Some of them we
      shall refer to at length as great performers, others were
      celebrated more as teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rodolphe Kreutzer, who was born at Versailles in 1766, is the
      third in order of development of the four great representative
      masters of the classical violin school of Paris; the others being
      Viotti, first, Rode, second, and Baillot, fourth. With Baillot
      he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id=
      "page69"></a>{69}</span> compiled the famous "Methode de Violon"
      for the use of the students at the Conservatoire. Kreutzer's
      first teacher was his father, who was a musician in the king's
      chapel, but he was soon placed under Anton Stamitz, and at the
      age of thirteen he played a concerto in public, with great
      success. This is said by some writers to have been his own
      composition, though by others it was attributed to his teacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kreutzer made a tour through the north of Italy, Germany, and
      Holland, during which he acquired the reputation of being one of
      the first violinists in Europe. On his return to Paris, he turned
      his attention to dramatic music, and composed two grand operas,
      which were performed before the court, and secured for him the
      patronage of Marie Antoinette. He also became first violin at the
      Opéra Comique, and professor at the Conservatoire, where he
      formed some excellent pupils, among them being
      D'Artot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id=
      "page70"></a>{70}</span> Rovelli, the teacher of Molique,
      Massart, the teacher of Wieniawski and Teresina Tua, and Lafont,
      who also became a pupil of De Bériot. On Rode's departure for
      Russia, Kreutzer succeeded him as solo violin at the Opéra, later
      becoming Chef d'Orchestre, and after fourteen years' service in
      this capacity he was decorated with the insignia of the Legion of
      Honour, and became General Director of the Music at the Opéra. In
      1826 he resigned his post and retired to Geneva, where he died in
      1831. Kreutzer was a prolific composer, and his compositions
      include forty dramatic works and a great number of pieces for the
      violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1798, when Kreutzer was at Vienna in the service of the French
      ambassador, Bernadotte, he made the acquaintance of Beethoven,
      and was afterwards honoured by that great composer with the
      dedication to him of the famous Sonata, Op. 47, which was first
      played by Beethoven and the vio<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page71" id="page71"></a>{71}</span> linist Bridgetower, at the
      Augarten, in May, 1803, either the 17th or the 24th. This is the
      sonata the name of which Count Leo Tolstoi took for his famous
      book, though to the vast majority of hearers it will always
      remain a mystery how the classical harmonies of the sonata could
      have aroused the passions which form the <i>raison d'être</i> of
      the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kreutzer was noted for his style of bowing, his splendid tone,
      and the clearness of his execution.
    </p>
    <p>
      With three such masters as Baillot, Rode, and Kreutzer, besides
      Viotti, who was frequently in Paris, the French school of violin
      playing had now superseded the Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pierre Marie François de Sales Baillot, who was associated with
      Rode and Kreutzer in the compilation of the celebrated "Methode
      du Violon," was born at Passy, near Paris, in 1771, and became
      one of the most excellent violinists that France ever<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>{72}</span> produced.
      His eminence in his profession was not obtained without a long
      struggle against great difficulties, for at the age of twelve he
      lost his father, who had kept a school, and became dependent upon
      friends for his education. His musical talent was remarkable at
      an early age, and he received his first instruction from an
      Italian named Polidori. At the age of nine he was placed under a
      French teacher named Sainte-Marie, whose training gave him the
      severe state and methodical qualities by which his playing was
      always distinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      His love for his instrument was greatly augmented when, at the
      age of ten, he heard Viotti play one of his concertos, and from
      that day the great violinist became his model.
    </p>
    <p>
      When his father died a year or two later, a government official,
      M. de Boucheporn, sent him, with his own children, to Rome, where
      he was placed with Pollani, a pupil of<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>{73}</span> Nardini,
      under whom he made rapid progress, and soon began to play in
      public. He was, however, unable to follow directly in the path of
      his profession, and for five years he travelled with his
      benefactor, acting as private secretary, and securing but little
      time for his violin playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1791 he returned to Paris, and Viotti secured a place for him
      in the opera orchestra, but on being offered a position in the
      Ministère des Finances, he gave up his operatic work, and for
      some years devoted only his leisure to the study of the violin.
      He now had to serve with the army for twenty months, at the end
      of which time he once more determined to take up music as a
      profession, and soon appeared in public with a concerto of
      Viotti. This performance established his reputation, and he was
      offered a professorship of violin playing at the Conservatoire,
      then recently opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      His next appointment was to the private<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>{7}</span> band of
      Napoleon, after which he travelled for three years in Russia with
      the violoncello player Lemare, earning great fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to Paris, he established concerts for chamber music,
      which proved successful, and built up for him a reputation as an
      unrivalled quartet player. He travelled again, visiting Holland,
      Belgium, and England, and then he became leader of the opera band
      in Paris and of the royal band. He made a final tour in
      Switzerland in 1833, and died in 1842.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baillot is considered to have been the last distinguished
      representative of the great classical school of violin playing in
      Paris. In his "L'Art du Violon" he points out the chief
      distinction between the old and the modern style of violin
      playing to be the absence of the dramatic element in the former,
      and its predominance in the latter, thus enabling the executive
      art to follow the progress marked out by the composer,
      and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id=
      "page75"></a>{75}</span> to bring out the powerful contrasts and
      enlarged ideas of the modern musical compositions. After the time
      of Baillot and his contemporaries the style of Paganini became
      predominant in Paris, but the influence of the Paris school
      extended to Germany, where Spohr must be considered the direct
      descendant artistically of Viotti and Rode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the most illustrious pupil of Viotti was Pierre Rode, who
      was born at Bordeaux in 1774, and exhibited such exceptional
      talent that at the age of sixteen he was one of the violins at
      the Théâtre Feydeau in Paris. He had made his début in Paris at
      the Théâtre de Monsieur, when he played Viotti's thirteenth
      concerto with complete success. In 1794 he began to travel, and
      made a tour through Holland and North Germany, visiting England,
      driven there by stress of weather, on his way home. He appeared
      once in London, and then left for Holland and Germany again. On
      his return<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id=
      "page76"></a>{76}</span> to France he was appointed professor of
      the violin at the Conservatoire, then newly established. In 1799
      ne made a trip to Spain, where he met Boccherini. The following
      year he returned to Paris, where he was made solo violinist to
      the First Consul, and it was at this period that he gained his
      greatest success, when he played with Kreutzer a duo concertante
      of the latter's composition. After this he went to Russia, where
      he was enthusiastically received, and was appointed one of the
      emperor's musicians. The life in Russia, however, overtaxing his
      strength, from that time his powers began to fail, and he met
      with many disappointments. In 1814 he married, and, although he
      made an unsuccessful attempt to renew his public career, he may
      be said to have retired. He died at Bordeaux in 1830.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of Rode's playing in his best days we are told that he displayed
      all the best qualities of a grand, noble, pure, and thoroughly
      musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id=
      "page77"></a>{77}</span> style. His intonation was perfect, his
      tone large and pure, and boldness, vigour, deep and tender
      feeling characterised his performances. In fact he was no mere
      virtuoso but a true artist. His musical nature shows itself in
      his compositions, which are thoroughly suited to the nature of
      the violin, and have a noble, dignified character and
      considerable charm of melody, though they show only moderate
      creative power. He had few pupils, but his influence through his
      example during his travels, and through his compositions, was
      very great indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beethoven wrote for Rode, after hearing him play in Vienna, the
      famous violin Romance in F, Op. 50, one of the highest possible
      testimonials to Rode's ability as a violinist. It is known,
      however, that he was obliged to seek assistance in scoring his
      own compositions, and therefore lacked an important part of a
      musical education.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most celebrated pupil of Baillot was<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>{78}</span> François
      Antoine Habeneck, the son of a musician in a French regimental
      band. During his early youth Habeneck was taught by his father,
      and at the age of ten played concertos in public. He visited many
      places with his father's regiment, which was finally stationed at
      Brest. At the age of twenty he went to Paris and entered the
      Conservatoire, where in 1804 he was awarded first prize for
      violin playing, and became a sub-professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Empress Josephine, on hearing him play, was so pleased that
      she granted him a pension of twelve hundred francs. He became one
      of the first violins at the Opéra, but his special forte was as
      leader of orchestras, and he held that post at the Conservatoire,
      on account of his efficiency, until 1815, when the advent of the
      allied armies caused it to be closed.

      Habeneck was instrumental in bringing forward the great
      orchestral works of Bee<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id=
      "page79"></a>{79}</span> thoven. He became director of the Grand
      Opéra, and inspector-general of the Conservatoire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Habeneck is said to have been greatly addicted to taking snuff,
      and this habit led to an amusing episode with Berlioz, which the
      latter regarded in a very unfriendly light. At a public
      performance of the Requiem of Berlioz, the composer had arranged
      with Habeneck to conduct the music, Berlioz taking his seat close
      behind the conductor. The work was commenced, and had been
      proceeded with some little time, when Habeneck (presumably taking
      advantage of what seemed to him a favourable moment) placed his
      baton on the desk, took out his snuff-box, and proceeded to take
      a pinch. Berlioz, aware of the breakers ahead, rushed to the helm
      and saved the wreck of his composition by beating time with his
      arm. Habeneck, when the danger was passed, said, "What a cold
      perspiration I was in! Without you<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page80" id="page80"></a>{80}</span> we should assuredly have
      been lost." "Yes," said the composer, "I know it well,"
      accompanying his words with an expression of countenance
      betokening suspicion of Habeneck's honesty of purpose. The
      violinist little dreamed that this gratification of his weakness
      for snuff-taking would be regarded in the pages of Berlioz's
      Memoirs as having been indulged in from base motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Habeneck died in 1849. He published only a few of his
      compositions.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most eminent violinists of the French school, who
      flourished during the early part of the nineteenth century, was
      Charles Philippe Lafont. Besides brilliant technical capabilities
      he had a sympathetic tone and a most elegant style, and these
      qualities gave him a very high position in the ranks of
      performers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lafont was born at Paris, December 7, 1781, and received his
      first lessons from his mother, who afterward placed him under
      her<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id=
      "page81"></a>{81}</span> brother, Berthaume. Under his care he
      made a successful concert tour through Germany and other
      countries as early as 1792, after which he returned to Paris and
      settled down to study under Rudolf Kreutzer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time his studies were interrupted by an attempt to become a
      singer, and he appeared at the Théâtre Feydeau, which had then
      been opened by Viotti. This diversion being soon at an end, he
      returned to the violin, but on the outbreak of the revolution in
      France he left the country and travelled throughout Europe, being
      absent from Paris, with the exception of a short visit in 1805,
      until 1815.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his travels he was made chamber virtuoso to the Czar
      Alexander, and on his return to France he became first violinist
      of the royal chamber musicians of Louis XVIII., and musical
      accompanist to the Duchesse de Berry.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>{82}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Lafont's career came to a sudden end by the overturning of a
      carriage while on a concert tour in the south of France in 1839.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of the numerous violinists who challenged Paganini to
      an artistic duel, in which he got the worst of it, though his
      admirers accounted for his defeat by the fact that the contest
      took place at La Scala, in Milan, where the sympathy of the
      audience was in favour of the Italian virtuoso.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lafont was a prolific composer, but few of his works have
      survived. He was also the owner of a magnificent Guarnerius
      violin, which is now said to be the property of Adolf Brodsky.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a composer Spohr probably influenced the modern style of
      violin playing even more than as a player, for he lifted the
      concerto to the dignity of a work of art, whereas it had formerly
      been simply a show piece, though not always without merit. He set
      a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id=
      "page83"></a>{83}</span> example of purity of style and
      legitimate treatment of the instrument, and is considered to have
      had a more beneficial effect on violin playing than Paganini, who
      was born in the same year, 1784.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Spohr was the son of a physician, who, two years after
      Louis was born at Brunswick, took up his residence at Seesen,
      where the childhood of the future virtuoso was passed. Both
      father and mother were musical, the former playing the flute,
      while the latter was a pianist and singer. It is said that young
      Spohr showed his talents remarkably early, and was able to sing
      duets with his mother when only four years of age. At five he
      began to learn the violin and at six he could take part in
      Kalkbrenner's trios. He also began to compose music, and under
      his father's methodical guidance acquired the habit of finishing
      everything that he began to write, without erasure or alteration.
      His instruction in the art of composition was<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>{84}</span> confined
      to the mere rudiments, and he acquired the art chiefly by
      studying the scores of the great composers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spohr's first public appearance was at a school concert, and such
      was his success that he was asked to repeat the performance at a
      concert given by the duke's band. More study ensued, and then, at
      the age of fourteen, he undertook to make his first artistic
      tour, and set out for Hamburg, carrying with him some letters of
      introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems that the people of Hamburg did not show much enthusiasm
      over the young artist, for he was unable to arrange a hearing,
      and, having exhausted his funds, he returned to Brunswick in the
      time-honoured manner of unsuccessful artists,&mdash;on foot.
      Spohr's experience seems to have produced upon him the same
      effect that many aspiring young players have since felt, viz.,
      that he had better go on with his studies. He accordingly
      presented a petition to the Duke of<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page85" id="page85"></a>{85}</span> Brunswick asking for means
      to carry out his desires. The duke was pleased with him, and not
      only gave him a place in his band, but also agreed to pay his
      expenses while he studied with one of the most eminent teachers
      of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Viotti nor Ferdinand Eck could receive him as a pupil,
      but by the advice of the latter, young Spohr was placed under his
      brother, Franz Eck, who was then travelling in Germany. With
      Franz Eck an agreement was made by the duke, under which Spohr
      should travel with him, and study <i>en route</i>. During the
      continuance of this agreement Spohr practised sometimes ten hours
      a day, and being so constantly with his teacher he made great
      progress. On his return to Brunswick he was appointed first
      violinist in the duke's band, and the following year he once more
      undertook a concert tour on his own account, travelling through
      Saxony and Prussia, and meeting with great
      enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id=
      "page86"></a>{86}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      While in Russia he met Clementi and Field, and he was presented
      with a most valuable Guarnerius violin by an enthusiast. This
      instrument he lost while on the way to France, where he intended
      to make a concert tour. Just before entering Göttingen the
      portmanteau which contained the violin was taken from the coach,
      and owing to the delays of officialism it was never recovered.
      The thieves had been seen with the booty in their possession, but
      in order to arrest them it was necessary to travel some nine
      miles for the necessary warrant and officer. In the meantime they
      had disappeared, as thieves occasionally do.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1805 Spohr was appointed concert-master in the band of the
      Duke of Gotha, and while holding this position he met, wooed, and
      wedded the Fraülein Dorothea Scheidler, an excellent harp player,
      who for many years afterwards appeared with him in all his
      concerts, and for whom he wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page87" id="page87"></a>{87}</span> many solo pieces as well as
      some sonatas for violin and harp. In view of this important step
      the following description of Spohr's personal appearance may be
      interesting: "The front of Jove himself is expressed in the
      expansive forehead, massive, high, and broad; the speaking eyes
      that glance steadfastly and clearly under the finely pencilled
      arches of the eyebrows, which add a new grace to their lustrous
      fire; the long, straight nose with sharply curved nostrils,
      imperial with the pride of sensibility and spiritual power; the
      firm, handsome mouth, and the powerful chin, with its strong
      outlines melted into the utter grace of oval curves. In its
      calmness and repose, in its subdued strength and pervading
      serenity, it is the picture of the man's life in little." Spohr
      seems to have been somewhat attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another authority tells us, in less flowery language, that he was
      of herculean frame and very strong constitution.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>{88}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1807 he made a tour, with his wife, through Germany, and while
      at Munich the king showed his gallantry to Madame Spohr in a most
      gracious manner. The usher had neglected to place a chair on the
      platform for her, and the king handed up his own gilded throne
      chair, in spite of her protestations. The anecdote would be more
      satisfactory if it stated what the king sat upon during the
      concert, but that is left to the imagination. The king had some
      bad habits, and, we are told, was very fond of playing cards
      during the concerts. Spohr was not accustomed to having his
      audiences indulge in cards, and so informed the chamberlain,
      absolutely declining to play unless the cards were put aside for
      the time being. It was a delicate task that fell to the lot of
      the chamberlain, but he carried it through with the greatest
      diplomacy, each side making a slight concession: the king on his
      part promising to abstain from card playing during<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>{89}</span> Spohr's
      performance on condition that the violinist's two pieces should
      immediately follow each other on the program, and Spohr
      withdrawing his embargo from the whole concert on condition that
      the king would abstain from his favourite amusement during his
      particular performance. The king, however, seems to have put in
      the last blow, for on the conclusion of the violin solos he gave
      no signal for applause, and as it would be a breach of court
      manners for any one to applaud without his Majesty's consent, the
      artist was obliged to make his bow and retire amidst deathly
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1808 Spohr wrote his first opera, but although it was accepted
      for representation, it was never performed in public.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this year Napoleon held his celebrated congress of princes
      at Erfurt. Spohr was consumed by a burning desire to behold
      Napoleon and the surrounding princes, and went to Erfurt. Here he
      found that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id=
      "page90"></a>{90}</span> French theatrical troupe was performing
      every evening before the august assembly, but only the privileged
      few could by any possibility gain admittance to the theatre.
      Spohr's ingenuity was equal to the emergency, and making friends
      with the second horn player, he induced that artist to allow him
      to substitute for him one night. Spohr had never in his life
      attempted to play the horn, but it was now necessary for him to
      acquire the art before night, and he set to work with such vim
      that by the time of the performance his lips were swollen and
      black, but he was able to produce the requisite tones. The
      orchestra having received strict injunctions to sit with their
      backs to the brilliant assembly, probably to protect their
      eyesight from its dazzling effects, Spohr fitted himself out with
      a small mirror, and placing this upon his music-rack, he was able
      to enjoy for a couple of hours the vision of the great Napoleon,
      who, with his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id=
      "page91"></a>{91}</span> distinguished guests, occupied the front
      row of the stalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spohr remained at Gotha until 1813, when he was offered and
      accepted the post of the leadership at the Theatre an der Wien at
      Vienna, and while here he composed his opera of "Faust," which,
      however, was not produced at that time. He also wrote a cantata
      in celebration of the battle of Leipzig, which he did not succeed
      in producing, and not feeling satisfied with his position, and
      having various disagreements with the management, the engagement
      was cancelled by mutual consent. During his stay in Vienna Spohr
      was frequently in contact with Beethoven, and though he admired
      that great master he criticised some of his compositions very
      severely, and is said to have remarked that "Beethoven was
      wanting in aesthetic culture and sense of beauty," a remark
      difficult to understand in these later days. It is the more
      incomprehensible from<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id=
      "page92"></a>{92}</span> the fact that Spohr in after years was
      the very first musician of eminence to interest himself in
      Wagner's talent, for he brought out at Cassel "Der Fliegende
      Holländer," and continued with "Tannhäuser," notwithstanding the
      opposition of the court. He considered Wagner to be by far the
      greatest of all dramatic composers living at that time. In 1815
      he made a concert tour in France and Italy, during which he met
      Rossini and Paganini, playing at Venice a sinfonia concertante of
      his own composition, with the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Germany in 1817 Spohr was appointed conductor of
      the Opera at Frankfort-on-the-Main, where his opera "Faust" was
      now produced, also "Zemire and Azor." Owing to difficulties with
      managers again he left Frankfort after a stay of only two years,
      and his next venture was a visit to England, where he appeared at
      the concerts of the Philharmonic Society in London. His success
      was brilliant, for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id=
      "page93"></a>{93}</span> clear style and high artistic capacity,
      added to his reputation as a composer, carried him into
      popularity, and the artistic world vied with the public in doing
      honour to him. At his farewell concert, his wife made her last
      appearance as a harp player, for on account of ill-health she was
      obliged to give it up, and thereafter she played only the
      pianoforte.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way home from England Spohr visited Paris for the first
      time, and made the personal acquaintance of Kreutzer, Viotti,
      Habeneck, Cherubini, and other eminent musicians, who received
      him with the greatest cordiality. But the public did not seem to
      appreciate his merits, for his quiet, unpretentious style was not
      quite in keeping with the taste of the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his return to Germany Spohr settled in Dresden, and remained
      there until 1822, when he became Hofkapellmeister to the Elector
      of Hesse-Cassel, and he remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page94" id="page94"></a>{94}</span> Cassel for the rest of his
      life. This position he obtained on the advice of Weber.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1831 he completed his great "Violin School," which has ever
      since its publication been considered a standard work. The
      following year the political disturbances interfered with the
      opera performances at Cassel, and caused him much annoyance. In
      1834 he lost his wife, but his work of composition proceeded with
      vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1839 he again visited England, where his music had become very
      popular, and during the remainder of his career he repeated his
      visit several times, many of his works being produced by the
      various societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      His life at Cassel was not free from cares and friction, and he
      was subjected to many indignities and annoyances by the elector.
      Perhaps his sympathy with the revolutionists of 1848 was the
      chief cause of these petty persecutions. When Spohr married
      his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id=
      "page95"></a>{95}</span> second wife, Marianne Pfeiffer, the
      elector objected, and only gave his reluctant consent when Spohr
      agreed to waive the right of his wife to a pension. All his
      proposals were met with opposition. "Tannhäuser" was produced and
      well received, but a repetition of the performance was not
      allowed, and "Lohengrin" was ordered to be withdrawn from
      rehearsal, for Wagner was one of the revolutionists and was
      obliged to live in seclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      America is indebted to this revolution of 1848 for some excellent
      musicians, for the Germania Orchestra, an organisation of young
      revolutionists, sought these shores, and after a prosperous
      career, begun under great trials and discouragements, the various
      members settled in different cities and became identified with
      the musical life of the nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1851 the elector refused to sign the permit for Spohr's two
      months' leave of absence, to which he was entitled under
      his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id=
      "page96"></a>{96}</span> contract, and when the musician departed
      without the permit, a portion of his salary was deducted. In 1857
      he was pensioned off, much against his own wish, and in the
      winter of the same year he had the misfortune to break his arm,
      an accident which put an end to his violin playing. Nevertheless
      he conducted his opera "Jessonda" at the fiftieth anniversary of
      the Prague Conservatorium in the following year, with all his
      old-time energy. In 1859 he died at Cassel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through all his long career Spohr had lived up to the ideal he
      had conceived in his youth. He was a man of strong individuality,
      and invariably maintained the dignity of his art with unflinching
      independence. Even the mistakes that he made, as for instance his
      criticism of Beethoven, bore the strongest testimony to his manly
      straightforwardness and sincerity in word and deed. He was a most
      prolific composer, leaving over two hundred works in all. His
      violin <span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id=
      "page97"></a>{97}</span> concertos stand foremost among his
      works, and are distinguished as much by noble and elevated ideas
      as by masterly thematic treatment, yet there is a certain
      monotony of treatment in all, and his style and manner are
      entirely his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an executant Spohr stands among the greatest of all time. In
      slow movements he played with a breadth and beauty of tone, and a
      delicacy and refinement of expression almost unequalled. His
      hands were of exceptional size and strength, and enabled him to
      execute the most difficult double stops and stretches with the
      greatest facility. Even in quick passages he preserved a broad,
      full tone, and his staccato was brilliant and effective. He
      disliked the use of the "springing bow," which came with the
      modern style of playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spohr had a great many pupils, of whom the best known were Ries,
      Ferd. David, Blagrove, Bargheer, Kömpel, and Henry<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>{98}</span> Holmes. He
      was also considered one of the best conductors of his time, and
      introduced into England the custom of conducting with a baton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the amusing episodes in the life of Spohr was one which
      took place in London, when a servant brought him a letter
      desiring M. Spohr to "be present at four o'clock to-morrow
      evening at the closet of the undersigned," Spohr had not the
      faintest idea as to the identity of "the undersigned," nor the
      least inkling of that gentleman's design. He therefore replied
      that he had an engagement at that time. To this note he received
      another polite epistle asking him to be good enough to honour the
      "undersigned" with an interview, and to choose his own time. He
      therefore made an appointment, which he kept punctually, and on
      arriving at the house to which he was directed, he found an old
      gentleman, who was very genial, but who could speak
      neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id=
      "page99"></a>{99}</span> French nor German. As Spohr spoke no
      English the communication between them was of necessity carried
      on by pantomime. The old gentleman led the way into a room, the
      walls of which were literally covered with violins, from which
      Spohr gathered the idea that he was to pick out that which he
      considered the best. After trying them all he had to decide
      between the merits of half a dozen, and, when he finally gave his
      opinion, the gentleman seemed delighted, and offered him a five
      pound note to compensate him for his trouble. This the violinist
      declined to accept, for he had found as much enjoyment as his
      host, and considered it a privilege to be able to examine such a
      fine collection of beautiful instruments. The gentleman found a
      way of satisfying his ideas of compensation by buying tickets to
      the value of ten pounds, for one of Spohr's concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the most talented violinists of the early part of the
      nineteenth century was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id=
      "page100"></a>{100}</span> Karl Joseph Lipinski, the son of a
      Polish violin player whose gifts were uncultivated. He was born
      in Poland, in 1790, at a small town named Radzyn. After learning,
      with the aid of his father, to play the violin, he took up the
      'cello, and taught himself to play that instrument, and in later
      days he attributed his full tone on the violin to the power which
      his 'cello practice gave to his bow arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lipinski seems to have been an energetic and original man. He was
      in the habit of appearing at concerts both as violinist and
      'cellist. He was unable to play the piano, so when he was
      conductor of the opera at Lemberg he directed with the violin,
      and frequently had to play two parts, which gave him great
      command over his double stops. When the fame of Paganini reached
      him he set forth to Italy, that he might profit by hearing the
      great virtuoso, and when the opportunity came at Piacenza, he
      distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id=
      "page101"></a>{101}</span> guished himself by being the only
      person in the audience to applaud the first adagio. After the
      concert he was introduced to Paganini, and he did not fail to
      improve the acquaintance, frequently visiting Paganini and
      playing with him, sometimes even in his concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lipinski declined the honour of going on a concert tour with
      Paganini, as he wished to return to his home. On stopping at
      Trieste he heard of an old man, over ninety years of age, who had
      once been a pupil of Tartini, and sought him out in order to "get
      some points" on Tartini's style. The old man, Doctor Mazzurana,
      declared himself too old to play the violin, but suggested that
      if Lipinski would play a Tartini sonata he would tell him if his
      style reminded him of the great master. It did not, but Doctor
      Mazzurana brought out of a cupboard a volume of Tartini's sonatas
      having letter-press under the music, and this Lipinski
      was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id=
      "page102"></a>{102}</span> ordered to read in a loud tone and
      with all possible expression. Then he had to play the sonata, and
      after numerous attempts and corrections, the old man began to
      applaud his efforts. Lipinski ever afterwards profited by these
      lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later on he met Paganini again at Warsaw, where they were rivals,
      for the time being, and different factions waxed warm over their
      respective merits. Paganini himself, who is said to have been
      asked whom he considered to be the greatest violinist, replied,
      with conscious modesty, "The <i>second</i> greatest is certainly
      Lipinski."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lipinski travelled throughout Europe, meeting with great success,
      until in 1839 he was appointed concert-meister at the Royal Opera
      in Dresden, where he remained for many years. He also organised a
      string quartet, and was considered a most excellent performer of
      chamber-music. He wrote a large quantity of music for the violin,
      but[Pg 103<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id=
      "page103"></a>{103}</span> little of it was of a lasting quality.
      In 1861 he was pensioned, and retired to Urlow, near Lemberg,
      where he had some property, and there he died in December of the
      same year.

      PAGANINI.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name Paganini stands for the quintessence of eccentric
      genius,&mdash;one of the most remarkable types of mankind on
      record. Paganini was able to excite wonder and admiration by his
      marvellous technical skill, or to sway the emotions of his
      hearers by his musical genius, while his peculiar habits,
      eccentric doings, and weird aspect caused the superstitious to
      attribute his talent to the power of his Satanic Majesty. Yet
      Paganini was not only mortal, but in many respects a weak mortal,
      although the most extraordinary and the most renowned violinist
      of the nineteenth century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"

    <p>
      Nicolo Paganini was the son of a commercial broker, Antonio
      Paganini, and was born at Genoa, February 18, 1784. He was a
      child of nervous and delicate constitution, and the harsh
      treatment accorded to him by his father tended to accentuate and
      develop the peculiarities of his character. He was a good
      violinist at the age of six, and before he was eight years of age
      he had outgrown, not only his father's instruction, but also that
      of one Servetto, a musician at the theatre, and that of Costa,
      the director of music and principal violinist to the churches of
      Genoa. He had also written a sonata for violin, which was
      afterwards lost. At the age of nine he appeared in his first
      concert, given by Marchesi and Albertinatti in a large theatre at
      Genoa. At the age of twelve he was taken to Rolla, the celebrated
      violinist and composer at Parma, upon whom he made a great
      impression. When Paganini arrived with his father at Rolla's
      house they found<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id=
      "page106"></a>{106}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Paganini denied ever having taken lessons with Rolla, he
      nevertheless had frequent discussions with him concerning the new
      effects which he was continually attempting, and which did not
      always meet with the unqualified approval of the older musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      The music which he wrote for his instrument contained so many
      difficulties that he had to practise unremittingly to
      overcome<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id=
      "page107"></a>{107}</span> them, often working ten or twelve
      hours a day and being overwhelmed with exhaustion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1797 Paganini made his first tour, with his father, through
      the chief towns of Lombardy, and now he determined to release
      himself, on the first opportunity, from the bondage in which he
      was held by his father. This opportunity presented itself when
      the fête of St. Martin was celebrated at Lucca, and after much
      opposition he at last obtained the consent of his father to
      attend the celebration. Meeting with much success, he went on to
      Pisa, and then to other places, in all of which he was well
      received. Being now free from the restraint of his home he fell
      into bad company, and took to gambling and other vices, the most
      natural result of his father's harsh training showing itself in
      lack of moral stamina.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time his careless life had its allurements, but the young
      virtuoso was frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
      id="page108"></a>{108}</span> reduced to great straits, and on
      one occasion, if not more, pawned his violin. This happened at
      Leghorn, where he was to play at a concert, and it was only
      through the kindness of a French merchant, M. Livron, who lent
      him a beautiful Guarnieri, that he was able to appear. When the
      concert was over, and Paganini brought back the instrument, its
      owner was so delighted with what he had heard that he refused to
      receive it. "Never will I profane strings which your fingers have
      touched," he said, "the instrument is now yours." And Paganini
      used that violin afterwards in all his concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This violin was, some time later, the means by which he was cured
      of gambling, for having been reduced to extreme poverty, he was
      tempted to sell it. The price offered was a large one. At this
      juncture he won one hundred and sixty francs, which saved the
      violin, but the mental agony he endured through the affair
      convinced him that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id=
      "page109"></a>{109}</span> gamester is an object of contempt to
      all well regulated minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paganini won another violin by his ability to read music at
      sight. Pasini, an eminent painter and an amateur violinist,
      refused to believe the wonderful faculty for playing at sight,
      which had been imputed to Paganini, and in order to test it
      brought him a manuscript concerto containing some difficulties
      considered as insurmountable. "This instrument shall be yours,"
      said Pasini, placing in his hands an excellent Stradivari, "if
      you can play, in a masterly manner, this concerto, at first
      sight." Paganini accepted the challenge, threw Pasini into
      ecstasies, and became the owner of the instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      The severe course of dissipation in which Paganini indulged
      during these days of his youth ruined his health, and caused him
      frequently to disappear from the public gaze for long periods,
      throughout his career. With<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page110" id="page110"></a>{110}</span> the fair sex he had more
      than one romantic episode. At one time a lady of high rank fell
      in love with him and led him captive to her castle in Tuscany.
      Here the lovers solaced themselves with duets on the guitar, and
      the violinist attained a proficiency, on that instrument, equal
      to the expression of the tenderest passion. This adventure
      brought retribution in after days, and in a most unexpected
      manner, for as his genius began to excite the wonder of the
      world, sundry malicious stories concerning him were invented and
      circulated. One of these stories was to the effect that he had
      been imprisoned for stabbing one of his friends, another rumour
      said that he strangled his wife, and that during his imprisonment
      he had been allowed only the solace of playing his violin with
      but one string. This story was told in order to account for his
      wonderful one-stringed performances, and it was absolutely
      untrue, but the time allotted by rumour to his supposed
      imprisonment<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id=
      "page111"></a>{111}</span> coincided with the period which was
      really occupied with this romance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of three years he resumed his travels and his violin
      playing, returning to Genoa in 1804, where he set to work on some
      compositions. At this time he became interested in a little girl,
      Catarina Calcagno, to whom he gave lessons on the violin. She was
      then about seven years of age, and a few years later she became
      well known as a concert violinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paganini did not remain long in Genoa, for the following year
      found him wandering again, and another love affair in Lucca led
      to the composition of a piece to be played on two strings, the
      first and the fourth: the first to express the sentiments of a
      young girl, and the fourth the passionate language of her lover.
      The performance of this extremely expressive composition was
      rewarded by the most languishing glances from his lady-love in
      the audience, but the most important<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>{112}</span> result
      was that the Princess Elise Bacchiochi, sister of Napoleon,
      declared to him that he had performed impossibilities. "Would not
      a single string suffice for your talent?" she asked. Paganini was
      delighted, and shortly afterward composed his military sonata
      entitled "Napoleon," which is performed on the G string only.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ferrara he once nearly lost his life through unwittingly
      trampling upon the susceptibilities of the people, in the
      following manner. It appears that the peasantry in the suburbs of
      Ferrara bore ill-will toward the citizens of that town and called
      them "asses." This little pleasantry was manifested by the
      suburbanites in "hee-hawing" at the citizens when fitting
      opportunity presented itself. Now it happened that Paganini
      played at a concert, and some of the audience expressed
      dissatisfaction with the singer, Madame Pallerini, and hissed
      her. Paganini decided to have revenge, and when<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>{113}</span> about
      to commence his last solo, he amused the public by giving an
      imitation of the notes and cries of various animals. The chirping
      of various birds, the crowing of the chanticleer, the mewing of
      cats, the barking of dogs were all imitated and the audience was
      delighted. Now was the time to punish the reprobates who hissed.
      Paganini advanced to the footlights exclaiming, "This for the men
      who hissed," and gave a vivid imitation of the braying of an ass.
      Instead of exciting laughter and thus causing the confusion of
      the enemy as he expected, the whole audience rose as one man,
      scaled the orchestra and footlights, and swore they would have
      his blood. Paganini sought safety in flight. He was eventually
      enlightened as to the mistake he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once, when he was at Naples, Paganini was taken ill, and in his
      desire to secure lodgings where the conditions would be
      favourable for his recovery, he made a mistake<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>{114}</span> and
      soon became worse. It was said that he was consumptive, and
      consumption being considered a contagious disease, his landlord
      put him out in the street, with all his possessions. Here he was
      found by Ciandelli, the violoncellist, who, after giving the
      landlord a practical and emphatic expression of his opinion by
      means of a stick, conveyed his friend Paganini to a comfortable
      lodging, where he was carefully attended until restored to
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1817 Paganini was urged by Count Metternich and by Count de
      Kannitz, the Austrian ambassador to Italy, to visit Vienna, but
      several times he was prevented from carrying out his plans by
      illness, and it was not until 1828 that he reached Vienna and
      gave his first concert. His success was prodigious. "He stood
      before us like a miraculous apparition in the domain of art,"
      wrote one of the critics. The public seemed to be intoxicated.
      Hats, dresses, shoes, every <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page115" id="page115"></a>{115}</span> thing bore his name. His
      portrait was to be found everywhere, he was decorated and
      presented with medals and honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      He continued his tour through Germany, being received everywhere
      with the utmost enthusiasm, and he visited England, after a
      sojourn in Paris, in 1831.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home after an absence of six years, he was the
      possessor of a considerable fortune, part of which he lost by
      injudicious investments. Some friends induced him to join them in
      the establishment of a casino in a fashionable locality in Paris.
      It was called the Casino Paganini, and was intended to be a
      gambling-house. The authorities, however, refused to grant a
      license, and it was found impossible to support it by concerts
      only. After some vicissitudes a law-suit was established against
      Paganini, who was condemned to pay fifty thousand francs, and to
      be imprisoned until the amount was paid, but this decision was
      not reached until<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id=
      "page116"></a>{116}</span> Paganini was in a dying condition, and
      he went, by the advice of his physicians, to Marseilles, where he
      remained but a short time. Finding that his health did not
      improve, he decided to pass the winter at Nice, but the progress
      of his ailment was not checked, and on May 27, 1840, he expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his will, made three years previously, he left an immense
      fortune and the title of baron, which had been conferred on him
      in Germany, to his son Achille,&mdash;the fruit of a liaison with
      the singer Antonia Bianchi of Como,&mdash;whose birth had been
      legitimised by deeds of law. His fortune amounted to about four
      hundred thousand dollars, besides which he had a valuable
      collection of musical instruments. His large Guarnieri violin he
      bequeathed to the town of Genoa, that no artist might possess it
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his last illness Paganini, not realising that death was so
      near, devoted himself to music and to arranging for another
      con<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id=
      "page117"></a>{117}</span> cert tour. During his lifetime he had
      never paid much attention to religion and there were some doubts
      as to his belief. Although he expressed his adherence to the
      Roman Church, yet he dallied with its formalities, and when the
      priest visited him three days before his death to administer the
      final consolations of religion, the dying man put him off on the
      ground that he was not yet ready, and would send for him when the
      time came. Death prevented this, and burial in consecrated ground
      was therefore denied him. An appeal was made to the spiritual
      tribunal and in the meantime the body was embalmed and kept in a
      hall in the palace of the Conte di Cessole, whose guest he was
      during his last illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      People now began to come from all parts of Italy to pay honour to
      the dead artist, and this so angered the bishop and priests that
      an order was obtained for the removal of the body. Under military
      escort the remains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id=
      "page118"></a>{118}</span> the great violinist were taken to
      Villafranca and placed in a small room, which was then sealed up.
      And now Paganini became a terror to the ignorant peasants and
      fishermen, who crossed themselves as they hurried past the spot
      where the excommunicated remains lay. It was said that in the
      dead of night the spectre of Paganini appeared and played the
      violin outside his resting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime every effort was being made to secure Christian
      burial. The spiritual tribunal decided that Paganini had died a
      good Catholic. The bishop refused to accept the decision, and an
      appeal to the archbishop was unavailing. Eventually the case was
      brought before the Pope himself by the friends of the dead man,
      and the Pope overruled the decision of the archbishop and
      ordained that Christian burial should be accorded to the artist.
      On the 21st of August, 1843, the Conte di Cessole took away the
      coffin from Villafranca, and interred<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>{119}</span> it in
      the churchyard near Paganini's old residence at Villa Gavonà,
      near Parma. Thus even after death he was the victim of
      superstition, as he had been during his lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paganini resolved not to publish his compositions until after he
      had ceased to travel, for he was aware that his performances
      would lose much of their interest if his works were available to
      everybody. He seldom carried with him the solo parts, but only
      the orchestral scores of the pieces that he played. His studies
      were pronounced impossible by some of the best violinists of the
      day, so great were the difficulties which they contained, and in
      his mastery of these difficulties, which he himself created, may
      be found the true secret of his success. People accounted for it
      in many ways, one man declaring that he saw the devil standing at
      his elbow, and others stating that he was a child of the devil,
      and that he was bewitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id=
      "page120"></a>{120}</span> His compositions are remarkable for
      novelty in ideas, elegance of form, richness of harmony, and
      variety in the effects of instrumentation. Few compositions ever
      attained such fame as the "Streghe," of which the theme was taken
      from the music of Süssmayer to the ballet of "Il Noce di
      Benevento."
    </p>
    <p>
      While it may be readily admitted that many of the effects with
      which Paganini dazzled the multitude were tainted with
      charlatanism, yet the fact remains that no one ever equalled him
      in surmounting difficulties, and it is doubtful if, among all the
      excellent violinists of the present day, any of them compares
      with that remarkable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his studies have been adapted to the pianoforte by
      Schumann and by Liszt, and of the collection arranged by Liszt,
      consisting of five numbers from the Caprices, Schumann says: "It
      must be highly interesting to find the compositions of the
      greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id=
      "page121"></a>{121}</span> violin virtuoso of this century in
      regard to bold bravura&mdash;Paganini&mdash;illustrated by the
      boldest of modern pianoforte virtuosi&mdash;Liszt." This
      collection is probably the most difficult ever written for the
      pianoforte, as its original is the most difficult work that
      exists for the violin. Paganini knew this well, and expressed it
      in his short dedication, "Agli Artisti," that is to say, "I am
      only accessible to artists."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is doubtful whether any violinist ever lived concerning whom
      more fantastic stories were told. His gruesome aspect, his
      frequent disappearances from public life, his peculiar habits,
      all tended to make him an object of interest,&mdash;and interest
      is sometimes shown in eagerness to hear anything at all about the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      He enjoyed conversation when he was in the company of a small
      circle of friends. He was cheerful at evening parties,&mdash;if
      music was not mentioned. He had an excellent<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>{122}</span> memory
      for features and names of persons whom he had met, but it is said
      that he never remembered the names of towns at which he had given
      concerts. He was very severe with orchestras, and any mistakes
      made by them would bring forth a tempest of rage, though
      satisfactory work would be rewarded with expressions of approval.
      When he came to a pause for the introduction of a cadenza, at
      rehearsal, the musicians would frequently rise, eager to watch
      his performance, but Paganini would merely play a few notes, and
      then stopping suddenly would smile and say, "Et cetera,
      messieurs!" and reserve his strength for the public performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      His peculiarities were shown strongly in his arrangements for
      personal comfort while travelling, for his constant suffering
      precluded the enjoyment of the beauties of nature. He was always
      cold, and even in summer kept a large cloak wrapped around him,
      and the windows of the carriage care<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>{123}</span> fully
      closed. Before starting he took merely a basin of soup or a cup
      of chocolate, and though he frequently remained nearly the whole
      day without further refreshment, he slept a great deal and thus
      escaped some of the pain which the jolting of the carriage caused
      him. His luggage consisted of a small dilapidated trunk, which
      contained his violin, his jewels, his money, and a few fine linen
      articles. Besides this he had only a hat-case and a carpet-bag,
      and frequently a napkin would contain his entire wardrobe. In a
      small red pocketbook he kept his accounts and his papers, which
      represented an immense value, and nobody but himself could
      decipher the hieroglyphics which indicated his expenses and
      receipts. He cared not whether his apartment, at the inns on the
      road, was elegantly furnished or a mere garret, but he always
      kept the windows open in order to get an "air-bath," contrary to
      his custom while in a carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page124" id="page124"></a>{124}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      While the secret of Paganini's marvellous technique was incessant
      hard work, to which he was urged not less by his own ambition
      than by his father's cruelty, yet in later years he seldom
      practised, and his playing was chiefly confined to his concerts
      and rehearsals. There are several good stories dealing with this
      peculiarity. One man is said to have followed him around for
      months, taking the adjoining room at hotels, in order to find the
      secret of his success by hearing him practise. Once, when looking
      through the keyhole, he saw the virtuoso go to the violin case,
      take out the instrument, and after seeing that it was in
      tune,&mdash;put it back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Hallé tells about seeing Paganini in Paris, where he
      used to spend an hour every day sitting in a publisher's shop, "a
      striking, awe-inspiring, ghostlike figure." Hallé was introduced
      to him, but conversation was difficult, for Paganini sat there
      taci<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id=
      "page125"></a>{125}</span> turn, rigid, hardly ever moving a
      muscle of his face. He made the young pianist play for him
      frequently, indicating his desire by pointing at the piano with
      his long, bony hand, without speaking. Hallé was dying to hear
      the great violinist play, and one day, after they had enjoyed a
      long silence, Paganini rose and went to his violin case. He took
      the violin out, and began to tune it carefully with his fingers,
      without using the bow. Hallé's agitation was becoming
      intolerable, for he thought that the moment had arrived at which
      his desire was to be gratified. But when Paganini had satisfied
      himself that his violin was all right, he carefully put it back
      in the case and shut it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paganini was notoriously parsimonious, and it was related that
      one evening in Florence he left his hotel rather late, jumped
      into a coach and ordered the man to drive him to the theatre. The
      distance was short, but he felt that it would not do to keep
      the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page126" id=
      "page126"></a>{126}</span> public waiting. He was to play the
      prayer from "Moses" on one string. On arrival at the theatre he
      asked the driver, "How much?" "For you," replied the Jehu, "ten
      francs." "What? Ten francs? You joke," replied the virtuoso. "It
      is only the price of a ticket to your concert," was the excuse.
      Paganini hesitated a moment, and then handed to the man what he
      considered to be a fair remuneration, saying, "I will pay you ten
      francs when you drive me on one wheel."
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time Paganini astonished the world by making to Hector
      Berlioz the magnificent present of twenty thousand francs.
      Berlioz was at that time almost in a state of despair. His
      compositions were not appreciated, and he was at a loss to know
      which way to turn. He made a final effort and gave a last
      concert, at which Paganini was present and congratulated him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jules Janin, the celebrated critic and<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>{127}</span> writer,
      went into ecstasies over the affair. Paganini, he said, who had
      been attacked for hard-heartedness and avarice, was present at
      the concert, and at the end prostrated himself before Berlioz,
      and shed tears. Hope returned and Berlioz went home in triumph,
      for he had satisfied one great musical critic. The next day he
      received a note from Paganini enclosing twenty thousand francs,
      to be devoted to three years of repose, study, liberty, and
      happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Sir Charles Hallé's biography, however, this story receives
      important modifications. It appears that Armand Bertin, the
      wealthy proprietor of the <i>Journal des Debates</i>, had a high
      regard for Berlioz, who was on his staff, and knew of his
      struggles, which he was anxious to lighten. He resolved,
      therefore, to make him a present of twenty thousand francs, and
      to enhance the moral effect of this gift he persuaded Paganini to
      appear as the donor of the money. What would<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>{128}</span> have
      appeared as a simple gratuity from a rich and powerful editor
      toward one of his staff, became a significant tribute from one
      genius to another. The secret was well kept and was never
      divulged to Berlioz. It was known only to two of Bertin's
      friends, and Hallé learned it about seven years later, when he
      had become an intimate friend of Madame Bertin, and she had been
      for years one of his best pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paganini created the difficulties which he performed. He had a
      style of his own, and was most successful in playing his own
      compositions. In Paris, when, out of respect to the Parisians, he
      played a concerto by Rode, and one by Kreutzer, he scarcely rose
      above mediocrity, and he was well aware of his failure. He
      adopted the ideas of his predecessors, resuscitated forgotten
      effects and added to them, and the chief features of his
      performance were, the diversity of tones produced, the different
      methods of tuning his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id=
      "page129"></a>{129}</span> instrument, the frequent employment of
      double and single harmonics, the simultaneous use of pizzicato
      and bow passages, the use of double and triple notes, the various
      staccati, and a wonderful facility for executing wide intervals
      with unerring accuracy, together with a great variety of styles
      of bowing. The quality of tone which he produced was clear and
      pure, but not excessively full, and, according to Fétis, he was a
      master of technique and phrasing rather than a pathetic
      player,&mdash;there was no tenderness in his accents.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that Baillot used to hide his face when Paganini
      played a pizzicato with the left hand, harmonics, or a passage in
      staccato. Dancla, in his recollections, says: "I had noticed in
      Paganini his large, dry hand, of an astonishing elasticity; his
      fingers long and pointed, which enabled him to make enormous
      stretches, and double and triple extensions, with the utmost
      facility. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id=
      "page130"></a>{130}</span> double and triple harmonics, the
      successions of harmonics in thirds and sixths, so difficult for
      small hands, owing to the stretch they require, were to him as
      child's play. When playing an accentuated pizzicato with the left
      hand, while the melody was played by the hand of the bow, the
      fourth finger pinched the string with prodigious power even when
      the other three fingers were placed."
    </p>
    <p>
      There are anecdotes told of Paganini's artistic contests with
      rival violinists, chief among whom were Lafont and Lipinski, both
      of whom he eclipsed, and of his playing a concerto in manuscript
      at sight, with the music upside down on the rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of his appearance we are told, in an account of a concert in
      London: "A tall, haggard figure, with long, black hair, strangely
      falling down to his shoulders, slid forward like a spectral
      apparition. There was something awful, unearthly in that
      countenance; but his play! our pen seems invol<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>{131}</span>
      untarily to evade the difficult task of giving utterance to
      sensations which are beyond the reach of language." After
      detailing the performance, the account continues: "These
      excellencies consist in the combination of absolute mechanical
      perfection of every imaginable kind, perfection hitherto unknown
      and unthought of, with the higher attributes of the human mind,
      inseparable from eminence in the fine arts, intellectual
      superiority, sensibility, deep feeling, poesy, genius."
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to this accomplishment of playing on one string, a
      critic said: "To effect so much on a single string is truly
      wonderful; nevertheless any good player can extract more from two
      than from one. If Paganini really produces so much effect on a
      single string, he would certainly obtain more from two. Then why
      not employ them? We answer, because he is waxing exceedingly
      wealthy by playing on one."<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page132" id="page132"></a>{132}</span> Paganini seems to have
      reasoned from the opposite point, viz., that if the retention of
      two strings be regarded with such wonder, how much greater the
      marvel will be if only one is used.
    </p>
    <p>
      To offset these suggestions of charlatanism, or perhaps rather to
      show that, with all his charlatanism, Paganini was a marvel, we
      may see what effect his playing had upon some men who were not
      likely to be caught by mere trickery. Rossini, upon being asked
      how he liked Paganini, replied: "I have wept but three times in
      my life; the first, on the failure of my earliest opera; the
      second time, when, in a boat with some friends, a turkey stuffed
      with truffles fell overboard; and thirdly, when I heard Paganini
      play for the first time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Spohr, after hearing him play, in 1830, said: "Paganini came to
      Cassel and gave two concerts, which I heard with great interest.
      His left hand and his constantly<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page133" id="page133"></a>{133}</span> pure intonation were, to
      me, astonishing; but in his compositions and his execution I
      found a strange mixture of the highly genial and the childishly
      tasteless, by which one felt alternately charmed and
      disappointed."
    </p>
    <p>
      George Hogarth, the musical critic, writes about Paganini's
      "running up and down a single string, from the nut to the bridge,
      for ten minutes together, or playing with the bow and the fingers
      of his right hand, mingling pizzicato and arcato notes with the
      dexterity of an Indian juggler." It was not, however, by such
      tricks as these, but in spite of them, that he gained the
      suffrages of those who were charmed by his truly great
      qualities,&mdash;his soul of fire, his boundless fancy, his
      energy, tenderness, and passion; these are the qualities which
      give him a claim to a place among the greatest masters of the
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the finest description of Paganini is the one written by
      Leigh Hunt:<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id=

      1800 TO 1830.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paganini was an epoch-making artist. He revolutionised the art of
      violin playing, and to his influence, or through his example,
      were developed the modern French and Belgian schools. While
      Paganini was a genius, a great musician, and a wonderful
      violinist, he combined with these qualities that of a trickster,
      and the exponents of the modern French school adopted some of the
      less commendable features of Paganini's playing, while the
      Belgian school followed the more serious lines, and became a much
      sounder school.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alard, Dancla, and Maurin were exponents of the French school,
      while in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id=
      "page136"></a>{136}</span> of Belgium we have De Bériot, Massart,
      Vieuxtemps, Léonard, Wieniawski.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambert Joseph Massart was born at Liège in 1811, and was first
      taught by an amateur named Delavau, who, delighted with the
      remarkable talent displayed by his young pupil, succeeded in
      securing for him, from the municipal authorities of Liège, a
      scholarship which enabled him to go to Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival at the Conservatoire, Cherubini, who was
      splenetive and rash, refused him admission without assigning any
      reason for his decision, but Rudolph Kreutzer took upon his
      shoulders the task of forming the future artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding Massart's great talent and excellent capabilities
      as an artist, he never became a success as a concert player,
      because of his inordinate shyness, but as a teacher few have
      equalled him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Hallé, in his autobiography, tells a good anecdote
      concerning Massart's<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id=
      "page137"></a>{137}</span> shyness and modesty. Massart was to
      play, with Franz Liszt, a program which included the Kreutzer
      sonata. Just as the sonata was begun a voice from the audience
      called out "Robert le Diable," referring to Liszt's brilliant
      fantasia on themes from that opera, which he had recently
      composed, and had played several times with immense success. The
      call was taken up by other voices, and the sonata was drowned.
      Liszt rose and bowed, and presently, in response to the continued
      applause, he said: "I am always the humble servant of the public.
      But do you wish to hear the fantasia before or after the sonata?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Renewed cries of "Robert" were the only reply, upon which Liszt
      turned half around to Massart and dismissed him with a wave of
      the hand, but without a word of excuse or apology. Liszt's
      performance roused the audience to a perfect frenzy, but Massart
      nevertheless most dutifully returned and<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>{138}</span> played
      the Kreutzer sonata, which fell entirely flat after the dazzling
      display of the great pianist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few teachers have formed as many distinguished pupils as Massart,
      for in 1843 he was appointed professor of violin at the Paris
      Conservatoire, where his energy, care, exactness, and
      thoroughness brought him an immense reputation. Lotto,
      Wieniawski, Teresina Tua, and a host of other distinguished
      violinists studied under him: among them also was Charles M.
      Loeffler, of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Massart was also an excellent quartet player and gave many
      delightful chamber concerts, with his wife, who was a pianist. He
      died in Paris, February 13, 1892.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Auguste de Bériot, who holds a position of great
      importance in the history of violin playing and composition, was
      born in 1802 at Louvain. He had the misfortune to be left an
      orphan at the age of nine. His<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page139" id="page139"></a>{139}</span> parents were of noble
      extraction, but at their death he was left entirely without
      fortune, and was taken in charge by M. Tiby, a professor of
      music, who had noticed the little boy's love of the musical art,
      and had already taught him to such good purpose that he was able
      even at that time to play one of Viotti's concertos in public so
      skilfully that he received the hearty applause of the audience.
      He also took lessons of Roberrechts, one of Viotti's most noted
      pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Bériot was a youth of contemplative mind and of high moral
      character. He formed the acquaintance of the scholar and
      philosopher Jacotot, who imbued him with principles of
      self-reliance, and exerted an influence over him which lasted
      throughout his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Bériot learned from his guide, philosopher, and friend that
      "perseverance triumphs over all obstacles," and that "we are not
      willing to do all that we are able to do."<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>{140}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of nineteen De Bériot went to Paris, taking with him a
      letter of introduction to Viotti, who was then the director of
      music at the Opéra, and he succeeded in gratifying his greatest
      ambition, which was to be heard by that illustrious violinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viotti gave him the following advice: "You have a fine style.
      Give yourself up to the business of perfecting it. Hear all men
      of talent, profit by everything, but imitate nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      De Bériot applied himself assiduously to his studies, entering
      the Paris Conservatoire and taking lessons of Baillot. In a few
      months, however, he withdrew from the Conservatoire and relied
      upon his own resources. He soon began to appear in concerts,
      generally playing compositions of his own, which won him
      universal applause by their freshness and originality as much as
      by his finished execution and large style of cantabile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1826 he went to London from Paris,<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>{141}</span> his
      first appearance taking place on May 1st, before the Philharmonic
      Society. Wherever he appeared, either in London or the provinces,
      he was greeted with enthusiasm, and he established a lasting
      reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      His appearance in England antedated that of Paganini by about
      five years, and it has been questioned whether the impression
      which he made would have been less if he had appeared after
      instead of before the great Italian. It seems, however that De
      Bériot continued to meet with success even after the advent of
      Paganini. His playing was distinguished by unfailing accuracy of
      intonation, great neatness and facility of bowing, grace,
      elegance, and piquancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      After travelling for some years he returned to Belgium, where he
      was appointed solo violin to the King of the Netherlands. He had
      held the position but a short time when the revolution of 1830
      broke out and deprived him of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page142" id="page142"></a>{142}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned to Paris, and now began the most romantic portion of
      his life. Madame Malibran, whose brilliant career was then at its
      height, was singing in opera, and De Bériot became acquainted
      with her. The acquaintance ripened into the most intimate
      friendship, and in 1832 a concert company was formed, consisting
      of Malibran, De Bériot, and Luigi Lablache, the celebrated and
      gigantic basso. They made a tour of Italy, meeting with the most
      extraordinary success.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Bériot and the beautiful Madame Malibran were now inseparable.
      Malibran had for some years been living apart from her husband,
      an American merchant, who, with the view of supporting himself by
      her talents, had married her when on the brink of financial
      collapse. In 1835 she succeeded in securing a divorce from him,
      and then she married De Bériot.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few months after their marriage Mali<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>{143}</span> bran
      was thrown from her horse and sustained internal injuries of such
      severity that she died after an illness of nine days, and De
      Bériot became frantic with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than a year elapsed before he could at all recover from the
      effects of his irreparable loss, and his first appearance in
      concert, after this tragic event, was when Pauline Garcia, the
      sister of Madame Malibran, made her first début in a concert at
      Brussels given for the benefit of the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1841 De Bériot married Mlle. Huber, daughter of a magistrate
      of Vienna. He returned to Brussels, and became director of the
      violin classes at the Conservatoire, after which he ceased giving
      concerts. He remained in this position until 1852, when failing
      eyesight caused him to retire, and he died at Louvain in 1870.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his acquaintance with Madame Malibran, De Bériot was a
      suitor for the hand of Mlle. Sontag, and her rejection
      of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id=
      "page144"></a>{144}</span> him threw him into a state of
      despondency, from which it required the brilliancy and wit of
      Malibran to rouse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      De Bériot left a number of compositions which abound in pleasing
      melodies, have a certain easy, natural flow, and bring out the
      characteristic effects of the instrument in the most brilliant
      manner. There are seven concertos, eleven "airs variées," several
      books of studies, four trios and a number of duets for piano and
      violin. His "Violin School" has been published in many languages
      and used a great deal by students.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delphin Jean Alard was at one time a favourite violinist in
      France. In 1842 he succeeded Baillot as professor of violin at
      the Conservatoire in Paris. He was first soloist in the royal
      band, to which post he was appointed in 1858, and he was
      presented with the Cross of the Legion of Honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alard was born at Bayonne in March, 1815, and was well taught
      from his earliest<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id=
      "page145"></a>{145}</span> youth. He appeared in concerts at the
      age of ten, and at twelve entered the Paris Conservatoire, where
      he became a pupil of Habeneck, while Fétis taught him
      composition. He was the winner of numerous prizes, and he also
      wrote a great deal of music for the violin. His greatest pupil
      was Sarasate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alard married the daughter of Vuillaume, one of the best violin
      makers of France, and through him became the owner of one of the
      most beautiful Stradivarius violins. Alard died in Paris,
      February 22, 1881.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hubert Léonard was born at Bellaire, near Liège, in 1819, but
      unlike the majority of violinists he did not appear in concerts
      at an early age, nor did he enter the Paris Conservatoire until
      he was seventeen. At this time the wife of a wealthy merchant in
      Brussels took interest in him and provided the means necessary
      for him to go to Paris. In 1844 he appeared at Leipzig, and
      created a deep impression by the beauty of his tone<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>{146}</span> and his
      elegant performance. He travelled through Europe and played
      chiefly his own compositions, of which there are a great many,
      but his greatest fame was earned after he was appointed professor
      at the Brussels Conservatoire, where he had many pupils, of whom
      the most celebrated is, perhaps, Martin Marsick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the merits of Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst there seems to be
      a wide difference of opinion between various commentators. He was
      a man of warm, impulsive nature, whose playing was distinguished
      by great boldness in the execution of technical difficulties of
      the most hazardous nature. His tone had a peculiar charm, and at
      the same time his fiery, impetuous nature and uneven disposition
      led to certain occasional errors in technique and faulty
      intonation. Nevertheless, he was one of the most welcome
      performers in the concert halls of Europe for a number of years.
      He was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id=
      "page147"></a>{147}</span> thorough musician and a good composer,
      though his works are so full of technical difficulties as to be
      almost impossible of performance. Indeed it is said that some of
      them contained difficulties which even he could not always
      overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Born in Moravia at the town of Brünn in 1814, he entered the
      Vienna conservatory, and in 1830 made his first concert tour
      through Munich and Paris. Paganini was at that time travelling in
      Europe, and Ernst, in the desire to learn something from this
      great artist, followed him from town to town, and endeavoured to
      model his own playing upon the style of the Italian virtuoso, an
      effort which seems to have brought down upon him the censure of
      some critics, but which others have considered highly
      praiseworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1832 he settled in Paris, where he studied hard under De
      Bériot, and played in concerts frequently. After 1844 he lived
      chiefly in England, where he was highly ap<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>{148}</span>
      preciated, until the approach of his fatal disease made it
      necessary for him to give up, first, public performances, and
      then violin playing of any kind. He died at Nice after eight
      years of intense suffering, in 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ernst died the critic of the <i>Atheneum</i> compared him
      with other players of his day in the following words: "Less
      perfection in his polish, less unimpeachable in the diamond
      lustre and clearness of his tone, than De Bériot, Ernst had as
      much elegance as that exquisite violinist, with greater depth of
      feeling. Less audaciously inventive and extravagant than
      Paganini, he was sounder in taste, and, in his music, with no
      lack of fantasy, more scientific in construction.... The secret,
      however, of Ernst's success, whether as a composer or a virtuoso,
      lay in his expressive power and accent. There has been nothing to
      exceed these as exhibited by him in his best days. The passion
      was car<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id=
      "page149"></a>{149}</span> ried to its utmost point, but never
      torn to tatters, the freest use of <i>tempo rubato</i> permitted,
      but always within the limits of the most just regulation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the violinists of this period (those who were born between
      1800 and 1830) will be found those who first visited the United
      States. In 1843 Ole Bull found his way to these shores, and in
      the following year both Vieuxtemps and Artot were giving concerts
      in New York. A kind of triangular duel took place, for the
      admirers of Artot and Vieuxtemps, who were chiefly the French
      residents of the city, endeavoured to belittle the capabilities
      of Ole Bull, who nevertheless appears to have been very
      successful, and if anything, to have benefited by the
      competition. Musical culture was, at that time, in a very low
      state in America, and one may judge somewhat of its progress by
      the press criticisms of the artists who visited the country from
      time to time. It will be seen that those<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page150" id="page150"></a>{150}</span> who,
      like Ole Bull, Sivori, and Remenyi, applied their talents to the
      elaboration of popular airs and operatic themes were able to
      elicit the warmest praise. Vieuxtemps appears to have appealed to
      the cultured minority and was understood and appreciated by very
      few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flowery language was used without stint, and was frequently
      misapplied in the most ludicrous manner, as will be seen by the
      following extract:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Since the death of his great master, the weird Paganini, Ole
      Bull had been left without a rival in Europe. Herwig, Nagel,
      Wallace, Artot, and De Bériot can only 'play second fiddle' to
      this king of the violin. His entrance upon the stage is
      remarkably modest, and after the Parisian graces of Artot seems a
      little awkward; a tip of his bow brings a crash from the
      orchestra. He then lays his cheek caressingly on the instrument,
      which gradually awakes, and wails, and moans, like an infant
      broken of its slumber. Every tone seems fraught with human
      passion. At one time he introduces a dialogue, in which a sweet
      voice complains so sadly that it makes the heart ache with pity,
      which is answered from another string with <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>{151}</span>
      imprecations so violent and threatening that one almost trembles
      with fear. We fancied that a young girl was pleading for the life
      of her lover, and receiving only curses in reply. At the close of
      the first piece, the 'Adagio Maestoso,' there was one universal
      shout of applause, which afforded an infinite relief to a most
      enthusiastic house that had held its breath for fifteen minutes.
      Ole Bull came before the curtain and bowed, with his hand upon
      his heart. There is something different in his performance from
      that of any other artist, and yet it is difficult to describe the
      peculiarity of his style, except that he touches all the strings
      at once, and plays a distinct accompaniment with the fingers of
      his right hand. But the charm is in the genius of the man and the
      grandeur of his compositions. He knows how to play upon the
      silver cord of the heart which binds us to a world of beauty, and
      vibrates only when touched by a master hand."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The sentiments and emotions aroused in the breast of this critic
      appear to have been those with which Paganini inspired his
      audience, when he played a duet on two strings, as related in an
      earlier chapter. Ole Bull was a child of nature, he gave his
      audience a description of the beauties of nature, and<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>{152}</span> behold!
      it is interpreted as a story of human passions,&mdash;a high
      tribute to descriptive music.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following criticism seems more in keeping with the ideas
      known to have been held by the violinist, and almost leads one to
      imagine that the critic was fortunate enough to obtain an
      interview with the virtuoso before writing his account:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "FEBRUARY, 1844.
      </p>
      <p>
        "To what shall we compare Ole Bull's playing? Was it like some
        well-informed individual who has seen the world and who spices
        his tales of men and things with song and story--now describing
        the beauties of Swiss scenery, now repeating the air which he
        caught up one moonlight night on the Bosphorus, and anon
        relating a stirring joke which he gleaned on the Boulevard.
        Such a man would create an impression on any small tea-party,
        but that violin did more--the comparison fails. There might be
        to him who chose to give rein to his fancy a vision at one
        moment of the old ivy-covered church and the quiet graveyard,
        the evening sun streaming through the rich stained glass, the
        organ faintly heard through the long aisles and the deep
        chancel, and around and about the singing of some bird of late
        hours, and the hum of the bee as he flew by, well laden, to
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id=
        "page153"></a>{153}</span> his storehouse of sweets.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Then the clouds flew fearfully, and the wind moaned through
        the boughs of the old oak-tree in its winter dishabille, and so
        down to the seashore, when it rushed over cliffs and crags and
        knocked off the caps of the mad waves and sped on like a
        tyrant, crashing everything in its way and rejoicing in its
        might. And so we glided oddly but easily enough into the
        ballroom, where mirth and laughter, bright eyes, fairy feet,
        and all that was good and pleasant to behold flitted by. It was
        not all music that Ole Bull's violin gave out. There were old
        memories and pleasant ones, ideas which shaped themselves into
        all manners of queer visions; and the main difference between
        Ole Bull and those I have heard before him seemed to me to
        consist in this--that whereas many others may excite and hold
        by the button, as it were, the organ of hearing and the mind
        therewith immediately connected, Ole Bull awakens the other
        senses along with it and occupies them in the field of
        imagination."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      In 1846 came Sivori, and in 1848 Remenyi, both artists whose
      desire to please their audiences took them far from the path of
      the highest musical standard. It may be said with truth that the
      country was hardly ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"
      id="page154"></a>{154}</span> for musicianship of the highest
      quality, and even in 1872, when Wieniawski came with the great
      pianist and composer, Rubinstein, the two were accepted on their
      reputation rather than on their merits, which were understood by
      a comparatively small proportion of their audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although several violinists endeavoured to copy Paganini's style,
      or at least to learn as much as possible from hearing and seeing
      him play, there was only one, excepting Catarina Calcagno, who
      received direct instruction from him, and on whom his mantle was
      said, by his admirers, to have fallen. That one was Camillo
      Sivori, born at Genoa, June 6, 1817.
    </p>
    <div class="figcenter">
      <img src="images/camillo_sivori_page_154.jpg" width="350"
      height="517" alt="Camillo Sivori" title="Camillo Sivori" />
      <p>
        <b>Camillo Sivori</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      The connecting link between Sivori and Paganini began very early
      in the career of the former. Indeed it is said that the
      excitement of his mother, on hearing Paganini play at a concert,
      caused the premature birth of the future disciple of the great
      artist. Mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id=
      "page155"></a>{155}</span> vellous stories are told of Sivori's
      infancy. At the age of eighteen months, before he had ever seen
      or heard a violin player, he continually amused himself by using
      two pieces of stick after the manner of the violin and bow, and
      singing to himself. It is fair to say that similar precocity in
      other children has not always resulted in virtuosity. A case
      might be cited of a very young person who amused himself by
      inverting a small chair, and imagining that he was a street
      organist, but he grew to maturity without adopting that
      profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      At two years of age, the account continues, he cried out lustily
      for a violin, and when his father, reduced to submission by the
      boy's importunity, bought him a child's violin, he at once began
      to apply himself, morning, noon, and night, to practising on this
      instrument, and without any aid he was able in a short time to
      play many airs he had heard his sisters play or sing.
      His<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id=
      "page156"></a>{156}</span> renown spread through Genoa, and he
      was invited everywhere. At concerts and parties he was placed
      upon a table to play, and he was frequently called upon to
      perform before the king and the queen-dowager. He must have been
      a most wilful and embarrassing child, for the account goes on to
      say that he would not enter a church unless he heard music; but
      on the other hand, if he did hear music he insisted on going in,
      or else he would scream and make a terrible scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      These anecdotes, told by an effusive admirer, seem rather
      ridiculous, but when Paganini visited Genoa, and Sivori was six
      years old, the virtuoso took a great deal of interest in the
      little fellow and gave him lessons. He also wrote a concerto for
      him, and six short sonatas with accompaniment for guitar, tenor,
      and 'cello, and these the young artist soon played in public. In
      six months Paganini left Genoa and desired to take his young
      pupil with him, but this was<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page157" id="page157"></a>{157}</span> not allowed by the
      parents, and Sivori was placed under the tuition of Costa. Three
      years later Paganini returned to Genoa, and by his advice his
      protégé was placed under M. Dellepaine, who taught him taste and
      expression, his lessons with Costa in technique continuing. In
      1827 Sivori made a concert tour with M. Dellepaine, and visited
      Paris, where his playing at the Conservatoire won him great
      applause. He also appeared in England, after which he entered
      upon another serious course of study for several years, and
      perfected the tone which enraptured the world for so long, and at
      the same time he studied composition under Serra.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1839 his concert tours began again, and he visited Germany,
      Russia, Belgium, and Paris, where he played at the Conservatoire
      concerts and received the medal of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sivori now set out on extensive travels, and, after visiting
      England, proceeded, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id=
      "page158"></a>{158}</span> 1846, to America, travelling through
      the United States, Mexico, and various parts of South America,
      spending eight years in these peregrinations, and amassing a
      considerable fortune. During this great tour he met with many
      adventures, frequently travelling on horseback, and at one time
      being at death's door with yellow fever. On his return to Europe
      he shared the fate of many musicians who have achieved financial
      success, and lost his money by unfortunate investment, which made
      it necessary for him to resume his travels. He therefore visited
      Great Britain, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, Portugal, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was, of course, compared to many of the great violinists of
      his time, who all had their special merits. One criticism, in
      which Sivori is compared with Spohr, may be interesting: "Spohr
      is of colossal stature, and looks more like an ancient Roman than
      a Brunswicker; Sivori is the antithesis of <span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>{159}</span> Spohr
      in stature. Spohr has the severe phlegmatic Teutonic aspect;
      Sivori has the flashing Italian eye and variability of feature.
      Spohr stands firm and still; Sivori's body is all on the swing,
      he tears the notes, as it were, from his instrument. Spohr's
      refinement and polish have been the characteristics of his
      playing; in Sivori it is wild energy&mdash;the soul in
      arms&mdash;the determination to be up and doing&mdash;the daring
      impulse of youthful genius. Spohr's playing is remarkable for its
      repose and finish; Sivori electrifies by the most powerful
      appeals to the affections."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sivori was a man of generous impulses, and was seldom appealed to
      in vain to assist in a good cause. When his teacher, M.
      Dellepaine, was taken ill and was unable temporarily to fill his
      post of first violin at the theatre, and of director of the
      conservatoire at Genoa, Sivori replaced him in both and gave him
      the entire benefit of his ser<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page160" id="page160"></a>{160}</span> vices. After two years
      the teacher died, and Sivori still held the two places an entire
      year for the benefit of the widow, until a situation was procured
      for her which enabled her to live without further assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time Sivori felt that the instrument which he played was
      not so perfect as to satisfy him. He asked Paganini to sell him
      one, and the reply was, "I will not sell you the violin, but I
      will present it to you in compliment to your high talents."
      Sivori travelled to Nice to receive the instrument from his
      master's own hands. Paganini was then&mdash;it was in
      1840&mdash;in a deplorable condition, and could hardly speak. He
      signified a desire to hear his pupil play once more, and Sivori,
      withdrawing to a room a little way off, so that the sound of the
      instrument would not be too loud, played whatever Paganini called
      for. About two weeks later Paganini died.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1851 Hallé wrote of him as follows:<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>{161}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sivori was here lately, but caused little furore; such rubbish
      as the man plays now I had never heard, and really, as an artist,
      felt ashamed of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sivori continued to play in public until 1864, when he visited
      London and played at the Musical Union and elsewhere, but his
      triumph in Paris in 1862 must not be forgotten. On that occasion
      he executed Paganini's B minor concerto, and aroused immense
      enthusiasm, although he played immediately after Alard, who was
      at that time a prime favourite. During his later years Sivori
      lived in retirement, and he died February 18, 1894.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first person allowed to play on the celebrated violin
      which Paganini bequeathed to the city of Genoa. He was also the
      first to play, with orchestra, Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto in
      England. This performance was at the Philharmonic Society
      concert, June 29, 1846.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"

    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Vieuxtemps was one of the greatest violinists of his time.
      He was born at Verviers, in Belgium, in 1820, and was brought up
      in a musical atmosphere. So early did his talent develop, that he
      played a concerto of Rode in public at the age of six, and the
      following year made a tour with his father and his teacher,
      Lecloux, during which he had the good fortune to meet De Bériot,
      before whom he played. During four years he remained a pupil of
      De Bériot, and when that artist left Paris, in 1831, Vieuxtemps
      went to Brussels, where he practised hard, but without a teacher,
      until 1833, when he again set out on a prolonged concert tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this time on he seems to have spent the greater part of his
      time in travelling, for which he had a passion. He visited all
      parts of Europe and met most of the celebrated musicians of the
      day. Spohr, Molique, Schumann, Paganini, Henselt, and Richard
      Wagner were among the celebrities whom<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>{163}</span> he met,
      and in his tours he was associated with Servais, Thalberg, and
      other well-known artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not content with Europe as a field for conquest, he visited
      America in 1844, and again in 1857 and in 1870.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was offered many excellent positions, some of which he held
      for a time and others he declined. In 1845 he married Josephine
      Eder, an eminent pianist of Vienna, and shortly after was
      appointed solo violinist to the Emperor of Russia, relinquishing
      that post six years later in order to travel again. He was
      professor at the Brussels conservatoire from 1871 to 1873, and in
      1872 he was elected a member of the Academic Royale of Belgium,
      on which occasion he read a memoir of Étienne Jean Soubre.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1868 he suffered a double bereavement through the deaths,
      first of his father, and a short time later of his wife, and, to
      divert his mind from these troubles, he undertook a
      tour<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id=
      "page164"></a>{164}</span> which lasted three years. During 1873
      his active career was cut short by a stroke of paralysis which
      disabled his left side. He now travelled for health's sake, and
      went to Algiers, where he lived quietly for several years. His
      life was brought to an end by a drunken Arab, who threw a large
      stone at him while he was riding in his carriage one day,
      striking him on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a violinist Vieuxtemps possessed a wonderful staccato, both on
      the up and down bow. His intonation was perfect. He was fond of
      strong dramatic accents and contrasts. As a composer for the
      violin he had wider success than any one since Spohr, but while
      some of his works contain really fine ideas worked out with much
      skill, others are merely show pieces of no particular value.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a man Vieuxtemps had a gay and restless disposition. He was
      not easily depressed by trifles, and he enjoyed the<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>{165}</span> freedom
      of a life of constant change and travel, and it was during his
      travels that most of his best compositions were written.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the last few years of his active life, after his paralytic
      stroke had prevented his playing, he suffered much from his
      inability to demonstrate to his pupils the way in which certain
      passages should be played. Frequent outbursts of rage ensued, of
      which his pupils were obliged to bear the brunt, even to being
      prodded with his iron-shod stick. Sometimes scenes more amusing
      would occur, as when some grandees would visit the class, and
      Vieuxtemps would change his manner from smiles and affability
      while addressing them, to scowls and grimaces while talking to
      his pupils, the latter, of course, being invisible to the
      visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Vieuxtemps visited America in 1857, he was associated with
      Thalberg, the pianist, and together they visited many<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>{166}</span> towns
      and cities. Amongst the gems of American newspaper criticism they
      no doubt took with them several copies of the following, which
      appeared in the local paper of a town in Tennessee, and was
      headed "Thalberg and Vieuxtemps:"
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        "These distinguished individuals are now at Nashville, giving
        high pressure concerts, and selling tickets at two dollars
        apiece, when convenient. A stage-load and a half or two
        stage-loads of ladies and gentlemen went down from this place
        to hear them. Thalberg is said to be death, in its most horried
        shape, on the piano, and it is probably true; while Vieuxtemps
        is represented as a fiddler of considerable skill, considering
        his opportunities, which he no doubt is. We haven't heard
        either of them since they were quite small, and unless they
        come out here and reduce the price of their tickets to their
        value,--say about sixty-two and a half cents a dozen,--it is
        possible that we sha'n't hear them any more. When we ride forty
        miles, at an expense of at least ten dollars, extras not
        included, to hear a couple of itinerant Dutchmen torture a
        brace of unoffending instruments into fits, until the very
        spirit of music howls in sympathy, if some one will cave in our
        head with a brickbat, we will feel greatly obliged.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But seriously, Thalberg and Vieuxtemps have never done us any
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id=
        "page167"></a>{167}</span> harm that we know of, and we don't
        suppose they intend to. We wouldn't much mind hearing their
        music, for no doubt it is nearly, if not quite, as good as that
        of the average common run of Dutchmen, which, as the latter
        will tell you, is saying a good deal."
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      And yet musical culture was said to be in its infancy in America
      at that time!
    </p>
    <p>
      In Boston, Vieuxtemps, after an absence of fourteen years, was
      criticised thus: "We cannot see in M. Vieuxtemps the spark of
      genius, but he is a complete musician, and the master of his
      instrument. Tone so rich, so pure, so admirably prolonged and
      nourished, so literally drawn from the instrument, we have
      scarcely heard before; nor such vigour, certainty, and precision,
      such nobility and truth in every motion and effect. We recognise
      the weakness for sterile difficulties of extreme harmonics."
    </p>
    <p>
      Vieuxtemps was also subject to comparison with Sivori, rather to
      the former's disparagement. "The one plays the violin
      like<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id=
      "page168"></a>{168}</span> a great musician, the other like a
      spoiled child of nature, who has endowed him with the most
      precious gifts. Intrepid wrestlers, both, and masters of their
      instrument, they each employ a different manner. M. Vieuxtemps
      never lets you forget that he plays the violin, that the wonders
      of mechanism which he accomplishes under your eye are of the
      greatest difficulty and have cost him immense pains, whereas M.
      Sivori has the air of being ignorant that he holds in his hands
      one of the most complicated instruments that exists, and he sings
      to you like Malibran. He sings, he weeps, he laughs on the violin
      like a very demon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following paragraph is a good sample of New York musical
      journalism in the year 1844:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Vieuxtemps's first concert on Monday night was a very stylish
      jam. He is a small, puny-built man, with gold rings in his ears,
      and a face of genteel ugliness, but touchingly lugubrious in its
      expression. With his violin at his shoulder, he has the air of a
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id=
      "page169"></a>{169}</span> husband undergoing the nocturnal
      penance of walking the room with 'the child'--and performing it,
      too, with unaffected pity. He plays with the purest and coldest
      perfection of art, and is doubtless more learned on the violin
      than either of the rival performers [Ole Bull and Artot], but
      there is a vitreous clearness and precision in his notes that
      would make them more germane to the humour of before breakfast
      than to the warm abandon of vespertide. His sister travels with
      him (a pretty blonde, very unlike him), and accompanies him on
      the piano."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Vieuxtemps also visited America in 1870, with the celebrated
      singer Christine Nilsson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the celebrated violinists of this period must be mentioned
      Bernhard Molique, of whom Sir Charles Hallé says that he was a
      good executant, knowing no difficulties, but his style was
      polished and cold, and he never carried his public with him.
      "Ernst," he continues, "was all passion and fire, regulated by
      reverence for and clear understanding of the masterpieces he had
      to interpret. Sainton was extremely elegant and finished in his
      phrasing, but vastly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170"
      id="page170"></a>{170}</span> ferior to the others. Vieuxtemps
      was an admirable violinist and a great musician, whose
      compositions deserve a much higher rank than it is the fashion to
      accord them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Molique was the son of a town musician of Nuremberg, and became a
      composer whose works have stood the test of time. He was a pupil
      of Kreutzer and of Spohr, and held the position of director and
      first violinist of the royal band at Stuttgart. He had a number
      of excellent pupils, of whom John T. Carrodus was the best known.
      He died at Stuttgart in 1869.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henry Gamble Blagrove was a musical prodigy, who began the study
      of the violin at the age of four, and appeared in public a year
      later. He was born at Nottingham in 1811, and at six years of age
      played at Drury Lane. He studied abroad with Spohr, and appeared
      in Vienna in 1836, but the greater part of his life was spent in
      England, where he was soloist in several<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>{171}</span> of the
      best orchestras. He was a man of refreshing modesty, and was held
      in high esteem. He died in London in 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob Dont, of Vienna, and Jean Dancla, a French violinist, both
      belong to this period, and were teachers of reputation.

      OLE BULL.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A typical Norseman, erect of bearing, with a commanding presence
      and mobile, kindly face, from which the eyes shone clear and
      fearless as the spirits of old Norway hovering over his native
      mountains. He was a man to evoke respect and love under all
      conditions, and, when he stepped before an audience, roused an
      instantaneous throb of sympathy, of interest, before the sweep of
      his magical bow enthralled their souls with its melodious
      measures." Such is an excellent pen picture of Ole Bull, who
      during the middle of the nineteenth century was known far and
      wide as a great violinist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
      id="page173"></a>{173}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the celebrated musicians of all nations, Ole Bull will
      always remain a striking figure. As a musician, none so eminent
      has been so essentially a self-made man, none has grown up with
      so little influence from outside, none with a technique so
      essentially self-discovered. As a son of his country, none has
      retained so sturdy a sense of patriotism; none has, amid the more
      brilliant surroundings of a life spent in the gayest cities of
      the world, refused to be weaned from the poor northern,
      half-dependent state from which he issued a penniless lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Olaus Borneman Bull was born at Bergen, in Norway, February 5,
      1810, and was the eldest of ten children. His father was a
      physician and apothecary. He was musical, as were several other
      members of his family, and little Ole's love for music was
      fostered to a great degree at home by the Tuesday quartet
      meetings, at which his Uncle Jens played the 'cello.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>{174}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the early part of the century, the proverb, "Spare the rod and
      spoil the child," was regarded as the foundation of education in
      most countries, and few children were allowed to spoil. All
      childish desires which conflicted with parental ideas were
      promptly suppressed by "the rod," until by sheer strength they
      proved to be unsuppressible. Then they became great virtues. It
      was thus with Ole Bull. His first desire to hear the quartet
      music, which he gratified by hiding under sofas or behind
      curtains, was rewarded with the rod,&mdash;for he should have
      been in bed. After a time a concession was made through the
      intervention of Uncle Jens, and Ole was allowed to become
      familiar with the best music of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncle Jens used to amuse himself with the small boy's
      susceptibility to music, and would sometimes shut him up in the
      'cello case, promising him some candy if he would stay there
      while he (Uncle Jens) played. But<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page175" id="page175"></a>{175}</span> Ole could never endure
      the ordeal for long. He had to come out where he could see and
      hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first violin was given him by Uncle Jens when he was five
      years old, and he soon learned to play it well without any
      instructor. He was not allowed to practise music until his study
      hours were over, and occasional breaches of this rule kept "the
      rod" active.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ole Bull's first instructor was a violinist named Paulsen, a man
      of convivial temperament, who used to come and enjoy the
      hospitality of Ole's father and play "as long as there was a drop
      in the decanter," with a view to educating the young artist, as
      he said. But Ole's parents were thinking of prohibiting the
      violin altogether on the plea that it interfered too much with
      his studies, when the tide of affairs was changed by the
      following incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Tuesday evening, Paulsen, who played first violin in the
      quartet, had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id=
      "page176"></a>{176}</span> convivial that he was unable to
      continue. In this unfortunate dilemma Uncle Jens called upon Ole,
      saying, "Come, my boy, do your best, and you shall have a stick
      of candy." Ole quickly accepted the challenge, and as the quartet
      was one which he had several times heard, he played each movement
      correctly, much to the astonishment of all present.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened on his eighth birthday, and the event marked an
      epoch in his life, for he was elected an active member of the
      Tuesday club, and began to take lessons regularly of the
      convivial Paulsen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a pathetic story of how Ole induced his father to buy a
      new violin for him, and, unable to restrain his desire to play
      it, he got up in the night, opened the case, and touched the
      strings. This furtive touch merely served to whet his appetite,
      and he tried the bow. Then he began to play very softly; then,
      carried away with enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page177" id="page177"></a>{177}</span> he played louder and
      louder, until suddenly he felt the sharp sting of his father's
      whip across his shoulders, and the little violin fell to the
      floor and was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1819 to 1822 Ole Bull received no violin instruction, for
      Paulsen had left Bergen without explanation, though it has been
      hinted that Ole Bull had outgrown him, and on that account he
      thought it wise to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1822 a Swedish violinist came to Bergen, and Ole took lessons
      of him. His name was Lundholm, and he was a pupil of Baillot.
      Lundholm was very strict and would admit of no departure from
      established rules. He quite failed to make the boy hold his
      instrument according to the accepted method, but his custom of
      making his pupil stand upright, with his head and back against
      the wall while playing, no doubt gave to him that repose and
      grace of bearing which was so noticeable in later years. Lundholm
      was, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id=
      "page178"></a>{178}</span> quite unable to control his precocious
      pupil and a coolness soon sprung up between them, which appears
      to have culminated in the following incident.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a Tuesday evening, at one of the regular meetings, Lundholm
      played Baillot's "Caprizzi," but Ole Bull was much disappointed
      at the pedantic, phlegmatic manner in which he rendered the
      passionate phrases. When the company went to supper Ole found on
      the leader's music-rack a concerto of Spohr's, and began to try
      it over. Carried away with the music, he forgot himself, and was
      discovered by Lundholm on his return, and scolded for his
      presumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What impudence!" said the violinist. "Perhaps you think you
      could play this at sight, boy?" "Yes," was the reply, "I think I
      could." His remark was heard by the rest of the company, who were
      now returning, and they all insisted that he should try it. He
      played the allegro, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"
      id="page179"></a>{179}</span> all applauded except Lundholm, who
      looked angry. "You think you can play anything," he said, and,
      taking a caprice of Paganini's from the stand, he added, "Try
      this." It happened that this caprice was a favourite of the young
      violinist, who had learned it by heart. He therefore played it in
      fine style, and received the hearty applause of the little
      audience. Lundholm, however, instead of raving, was more polite
      and kind than he had ever been before, and told Ole that with
      practice he might hope to equal him (Lundholm) some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years afterwards, when Ole Bull was making a concert tour through
      Norway, and was travelling in a sleigh over the snow-covered
      ground, he met another sleigh coming from the opposite direction,
      of which the occupant recognised him, and made signs to him to
      stop. It was Lundholm. "Well," shouted he, "now that you are a
      famous violinist, remember that when I<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>{180}</span> heard
      you play Paganini I predicted that your career would be a
      remarkable one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," exclaimed Ole Bull, "you were mistaken, for I did not read
      that piece, I knew it before." "It makes no difference," was the
      reply, as the sleighs parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      As young Ole approached manhood, and developed in strength and
      stature, we find him asserting his independence. His father, who
      intended him to be a clergyman, engaged a private tutor named
      Musaeus, who, when he found that Ole's musical tastes conflicted
      with his studies, forbade him to play the violin, so that the boy
      could only indulge at night in an inclination which, under
      restraint, became a passion. Ole and his brothers had long and
      patiently borne both with cross words and blows from this worthy
      pedagogue, and at length decided to rebel. Accordingly when one
      morning at half-past four the tutor appeared and dragged out the
      youngest from his warm<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id=
      "page181"></a>{181}</span> bed, Ole sprang upon him and a violent
      struggle ensued. The household was aroused, and in a few moments
      the parents appeared on the spot in time to see Musaeus prostrate
      upon the floor and suing for peace. Contrary to his expectations,
      Ole found himself taken more into his father's confidence, and as
      a result he became more desirous than ever of carrying out his
      father's wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1828 he went to the university in Christiania, where, in spite
      of the best intentions, he soon found himself musical director of
      the Philharmonic and Dramatic Societies, a position which gave
      him independence, and somewhat consoled him for his failure to
      pass his entrance examinations for the university. His father
      reluctantly forgave him, and he was now, in spite of everything,
      fairly launched upon a musical career.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not long contented to remain in Christiania. His mind was
      in a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id=
      "page182"></a>{182}</span> restless agitation, and he determined
      to go to Cassel, and seek out Spohr, whose opinion he desired to
      secure. He accordingly left Christiania on May 18, 1829. His
      departure was so hurried that he left his violin behind, and it
      had to be forwarded to him by his friends. This suddenness was
      probably caused by the fact that he had taken part in the
      observance of Independence Day on May 17th, a celebration which
      had been interdicted by the government.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Cassel he went to Spohr, who accorded him a cold
      reception. "I have come more than five hundred miles to hear
      you," said Ole Bull, wishing to be polite. "Very well," was the
      reply, "you can now go to Nordhausen; I am to attend a musical
      festival there," Bull therefore went to Nordhausen, where he
      heard a quartet by Maurer, of which Spohr played the first violin
      part. He was so overwhelmed with disappointment at the manner in
      which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id=

      that he came to the conclusion that he was deceived in his
      aspirations, and had no true calling for music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spohr was a most methodical man, and had no appreciation for wild
      genius. He saw only the many faults of the self-taught youth, and
      coldly advised him to give up his idea of a musical career,
      declining to accept him as a pupil. Some five years later, Bull
      having in the meantime refused to accept this advice, which did
      not coincide with his own inclinations, Spohr heard him play, and
      wrote thus of him: "His wonderful playing and sureness of his
      left hand are worthy of the highest admiration, but,
      unfortunately, like Paganini, he sacrifices what is artistic to
      something that is not quite suitable to the noble instrument. His
      tone, too, is bad, and since he prefers a bridge that is quite
      plain, he can use A and D strings only in the lower positions,
      and even then pianissimo. This ren<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page184" id="page184"></a>{184}</span> ders his playing (when he
      does not let himself loose with some of his own pieces)
      monotonous in the extreme. We noticed this particularly in two
      Mozart quartets he played at my house. Otherwise he plays with a
      good deal of feeling, but without refined taste."
    </p>
    <p>
      After his discouraging interview with Spohr, Ole Bull returned to
      Norway, making, on the way, a short visit to Göttingen, where he
      became involved in a duel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling that his own capabilities were worth nothing, after what
      he had seen and heard in Germany, Ole Bull returned home in a
      despondent state of mind, but, on passing through a town where he
      had once led the theatre orchestra, he was recognised, welcomed,
      and compelled to direct a performance, and thus he once more fell
      under the influence of music, and began to apply himself
      vigorously to improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1831 he went to Paris in order to hear Paganini, and if
      possible to find some oppor<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page185" id="page185"></a>{185}</span> tunity to improve
      himself. He failed to enter the Conservatoire, but he succeeded
      in hearing Paganini, and this, according to his own account, was
      the turning-point of his life. Paganini's playing made an immense
      impression on him, and he threw himself with the greatest ardour
      into his technical studies, in order that he might emulate the
      feats performed by the great Italian.
    </p>
    <p>
      His stay in Paris was full of adventure. He was hampered by
      poverty, and frequently in the depths of despair. At one time he
      is said to have attempted suicide by drowning in the Seine. There
      is also a story told to the effect that the notorious detective,
      Vidocq, who lived in the same house with him, and knew something
      of his circumstances, prevailed upon him to risk five francs in a
      gambling saloon. Vidocq stood by and watched the game, and Ole
      Bull came away the winner of eight hundred francs, presumably
      because the detective was known, and<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>{186}</span> the
      proprietors of the saloon considered discretion to be the better
      part of valour. It was a delicate method of making the young man
      a present in a time of difficulty, but one of which the moral
      effect could hardly fail to be injurious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time, when he was ill and homeless, he entered a house in
      the Rue des Martyrs in which there were rooms to let. He was
      received and treated kindly, and was nursed through a long
      illness by the landlady and her granddaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to secure a place in the orchestra of the Opéra Comique,
      but his arrogance lost him the position, for when he was
      requested to play a piece at sight, it seemed to him so simple
      that he asked at which end he should begin. This offence caused
      him to be rejected without a hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortune, however, began at last to smile upon him when he made
      the acquaintance of M. Lacour, a violin maker, who
      conceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id=
      "page187"></a>{187}</span> the idea of engaging him to show off
      his violins. Ole Bull accordingly played on one of them at a
      soirée given by the Duke of Riario, Italian chargé d'affaires in
      Paris. He was almost overcome by the smell of assafoetida which
      emanated from the varnish, and which was caused by the heat.
      Nevertheless, he played finely, and as a result was invited to
      breakfast the next morning by the Duke of Montebello, Marshal
      Ney's son. This brought him into contact with Chopin, and shortly
      afterwards he gave his first concert under the duke's patronage,
      and with the assistance of Ernst, Chopin, and other celebrated
      artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now made a concert tour through Switzerland to Italy, and on
      reaching Milan he played at La Scala, where he made an immense
      popular success, but drew from one of the journals a scathing
      criticism, which, however humiliating it may have been, struck
      him by its truth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id=
      "page188"></a>{188}</span>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "M. Bull played compositions by Spohr, Mayseder, and Paganini
      without understanding the true character of the music, which he
      marred by adding something of his own. It is quite obvious that
      what he adds comes from genuine and original talent, from his own
      musical individuality; but he is not master of himself; he has no
      style; he is an untrained musician. If he be a diamond, he is
      certainly in the rough and unpolished."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Ole Bull sought out the writer of this criticism, who gave him
      valuable advice, and for six months he devoted himself to ardent
      study under the guidance of able masters. In this way he learned
      to know himself, the nature and limitations of his own talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now arrive at the point in Ole Bull's career at which he
      became celebrated, and this was due to accident. He was at
      Bologna, where De Bériot and Malibran were to appear at one of
      the Philharmonic concerts. By chance Malibran heard that De
      Bériot was to receive a smaller sum than that which had been
      agreed upon for her services, and in a moment of pique she sent
      word that she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id=
      "page189"></a>{189}</span> unable to appear on account of
      indisposition. De Bériot also declared himself to be suffering
      from a sprained thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that Madame Colbran (Rossini's first wife) had one
      day heard Ole Bull practising as she passed his window, and now
      she remembered the fact, and advised the Marquis Zampieri, who
      was the director of the concerts, to hunt up the young violinist.
      Accordingly, Ole Bull, who had gone to bed very early, was roused
      by a tap on the door, and invited to improvise on the spot for
      Zampieri. Bull was then hurried off, without even time to dress
      himself suitably for the occasion, and placed before a most
      distinguished audience, which contained the Duke of Tuscany and
      other celebrities, besides De Bériot, with his arm in a sling.
    </p>
    <p>
      His playing charmed and captivated the audience, although he was
      almost overcome with exhaustion. After taking some food and wine
      he appeared again, and this time he<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page190" id="page190"></a>{190}</span> asked for a theme on
      which to improvise. He was given three, and, instead of making a
      selection, he took all three and interwove them in so brilliant a
      manner that he carried the audience by storm. He was at once
      engaged for the next concert, and made such success that he was
      accompanied to his hotel by a torchlight procession, and his
      carriage drawn home by the excited people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ole Bull continued his triumphant course through Italy. At Lucca
      he played at the duke's residence, where the queen-dowager met
      with a surprise, as Ole refused to begin playing until she
      stopped talking. At Naples he experienced the misfortune of
      having his violin stolen, and he was obliged to buy a Nicholas
      Amati, for which he paid a very high price. After playing and
      making a great success in Rome, he returned to Paris, where he
      now found the doors of the Grand Opéra open to him, and he gave
      several concerts there.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"
      id="page191"></a>{191}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1836 he married Félicie Villernot, the granddaughter of the
      lady in whose house he had met with so much kindness during his
      first stay in Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the advice of Rossini, he went to London, where he made
      his usual success, notwithstanding the intrigues of certain
      musicians, who endeavoured to discredit him. Such was his
      popularity in England that he received for one concert, at
      Liverpool, the sum of £800, and in sixteen months' time he gave
      two hundred and seventy-four concerts in the United Kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now decided to visit Germany, and on his way through Paris he
      made the acquaintance of Paganini, who greeted him with the
      utmost cordiality. He went through Germany giving many concerts,
      and visited Cassel, where he was now received by Spohr with every
      mark of distinction. He played in Berlin, where his success was
      great, notwithstanding some adverse criticism. He<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>{192}</span> also
      played in Vienna and Buda-Pesth, and so on through Russia. At St.
      Petersburg he gave several concerts before audiences of five
      thousand people. He now went through Finland and so on to Sweden
      and Norway, where he was fêted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although closely followed by Vieuxtemps and Artot, Ole Bull was
      the first celebrated violinist to visit America, and in 1843 he
      made his first trip, landing in Boston in November of that year
      and proceeding directly to New York, playing for the first time
      on Evacuation Day. "John Bull went out on this day," he said,
      "and Ole Bull comes in." He remained two years in the United
      States, during which time he played in two hundred concerts and
      met with many remarkable adventures. During his sojourn he wrote
      a piece called "Niagara," which he played for the first time in
      New York, and which became very popular. He also wrote "The
      Solitude of the Prairies," which won more immediate
      success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id=
      "page193"></a>{193}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      He travelled during these two years more than one hundred
      thousand miles, and played in every city of importance. He is
      estimated to have netted by his trip over $80,000, besides which
      he contributed more than $20,000, by concerts, to charitable
      institutions. No artist ever visited the United States and
      received so many honours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1852 he returned to America, and this time he was destined to
      meet with tribulation. It was his desire to aid the poor of his
      country by founding a colony. He therefore bought a tract of land
      of 125,000 acres in Potter County, Pennsylvania, on the
      inauguration of which he stated his purpose: "We are to found a
      New Norway, consecrated to liberty, baptised with independence,
      and protected by the Union's mighty flag." Some three hundred
      houses were built, with a store and a church, and a castle on a
      mountain, which was designed for his permanent home. Hundreds
      flocked to the new colony, and<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page194" id="page194"></a>{194}</span> the scheme took nearly
      the whole of his fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ole Bull now started on a concert tour together with little
      Adelina Patti, her sister Amalia Patti Strakosch, and Mr. Maurice
      Strakosch. Patti was then only eight years old, and was already
      exciting the wonder of all who heard her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When crossing the Isthmus of Panama his violin was stolen by a
      native porter, and Ole Bull was obliged to remain behind to find
      his instrument, while the company went on to California. He was
      now taken down with yellow fever, and owing to a riot in the town
      he was entirely neglected, and was obliged to creep off his bed
      on to the floor in order to escape the bullets which were flying
      about. On his recovery he set out for San Francisco, but the
      season was too late for successful concerts. He was miserably
      weak, and when he played his skin would break and bleed as he
      pressed the strings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id=
      "page195"></a>{195}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      He now heard that there was some trouble in regard to his title
      to the land in Pennsylvania, and, hastening to Philadelphia, he
      was legally notified that he was trespassing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It transpired that the man who had sold the land to Ole Bull had
      no claim to it whatever, and had perpetrated a barefaced swindle,
      and now, having the money, he dared his victim to do his worst.
      The actual owner of the land, who had come forward to assert his
      rights, became interested in the scheme, and was willing to sell
      the land at a low price, but Ole now had no money. He instituted
      legal proceedings against the swindler, who, in return, harassed
      the violinist as much as possible, trying to prevent his concerts
      by arrests, and bringing suits against him for services supposed
      to have been rendered. It is even stated that an attempt was made
      to poison him, which only failed because the state of excitement
      in which he was at the time prevented his desire for
      food.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id=
      "page196"></a>{196}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ole Bull now set to work to retrieve his fortunes, but ill luck
      still followed him, and he fell a victim to chills and fever, was
      abandoned by his manager, and taken to a farm-house on a prairie
      in Illinois, where he endured a long illness. For five years he
      continued his struggle against misfortune, and during that period
      he made hosts of friends who did much to help him in one way and
      another. Nevertheless, when he gave his last concerts in New
      York, in 1857, he was still so ill that he had to be helped on
      and off the stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now returned to Bergen, where the air of his native land soon
      restored him to health. On his arrival, however, he found that
      the report had been circulated that he had been speculating at
      the expense of his countrymen, and that they were the only
      sufferers by his misfortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a short time he assumed control of the National Theatre, but
      before long he<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id=
      "page197"></a>{197}</span> was again on the road, giving concerts
      in various parts of Europe. While he was in Paris, in 1862, his
      wife died.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year 1867 found him again in the United States, and during
      this tour he met at Madison, Wis., Miss Sara C. Thorpe, the lady
      who was to become his second wife. He also took part in the Peace
      Jubilee in Boston, in 1869.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he sailed for Norway, in April, 1870 (he was to be married
      on his arrival), the New York Philharmonic Society presented him
      with a beautiful silken flag. This flag&mdash;the Norwegian
      colours with the star-spangled banner inserted in the upper staff
      section&mdash;was always carried in the seventeenth of May
      processions in Bergen, and floated on the fourth of July.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining years of Ole Bull's life were spent in comparative
      freedom from strife and struggle. He spent much of his time in
      Norway, but also found time for<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page198" id="page198"></a>{198}</span> many concert tours. His
      sixty-sixth birthday was spent in Egypt, and he solemnised the
      occasion by ascending the Pyramid of Cheops and playing, on its
      pinnacle, his "Saeter-besög." This performance took place at the
      suggestion of the King of Sweden, to whom the account was duly
      telegraphed the next morning from Cairo.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Boston Ole Bull was always a great favourite and had many
      friends. He felt much interest in the Norsemen's discovery of
      America, and took steps to bring the subject before the people of
      Boston. The result of his efforts is to be seen in the statue of
      Lief Ericsson, commemorative of the event, which adorns the
      Public Gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March and April, 1880, Ole Bull appeared at a few concerts in
      the Eastern cities, with Miss Thursby, and in June he sailed, for
      the last time, from America. He was in poor health, but, contrary
      to all hopes, the sea voyage did not improve his
      condition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id=
      "page199"></a>{199}</span> and much anxiety was felt until his
      home was reached. A few weeks later he died, and, at the funeral,
      honours more than royal were shown. In the city of Bergen all
      business was suspended, and the whole population of the city
      stood waiting to pay their last respects to the celebrated
      musician and patriot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ole Bull was a man of remarkable character and an artist of
      undoubted genius. All who heard him, or came in contact with him,
      agree that he was far from being an ordinary man. Tall, of
      athletic build, with large blue eyes and rich flaxen hair, he was
      the very type of the Norseman, and there was something in his
      personal appearance and conversation which acted with almost
      magnetic power on those who approached him. He was a prince of
      story-tellers, and his fascination in this respect was
      irresistible to young and old alike, and its effect not unlike
      his violin playing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id=
      "page200"></a>{200}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to his playing, his technical proficiency was such as
      very few violinists have ever attained to. His double stopping
      was perfect, his staccato, both upward and downward, of the
      utmost brilliancy, and though he cannot be considered a serious
      musician in the highest sense of the word, he played with warm
      and poetical, if somewhat sentimental, feeling. He has often been
      described as the "flaxen-haired Paganini," and his style was to a
      great extent influenced by Paganini, but only so far as
      technicalities are concerned. In every other respect there was a
      wide difference, for while Paganini's manner was such as to
      induce his hearers to believe that they were under the spell of a
      demon, Ole Bull took his hearers to the dreamy moonlit regions of
      the North. It is this power of conveying a highly poetic charm
      which enabled him to fascinate his audiences, and it is a power
      far beyond any mere trickster or charlatan. He was frequently
      condemned by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id=
      "page201"></a>{201}</span> critics for playing popular airs,
      which indeed formed his greatest attraction for the masses of the
      people. He seldom played the most serious music, in fact, he
      confined himself almost entirely to his own compositions, most of
      which were of a nature to meet the demand of his American
      audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ole Bull played in Boston in 1852, after having been absent
      for several years, during which time other violinists had been
      heard, John S. Dwight wrote of his performance thus: "We are
      wearied and confused by any music, however strongly tinged with
      any national or individual spirit, however expressive in detail,
      skilful in execution, and original or bold, or intense in
      feeling, if it does not at the same time impress us by its unity
      as a whole, by its development from first to last of one or more
      pregnant themes. As compositions, therefore, we do not feel
      reconciled to what Ole Bull seems fond of playing.... He cannot
      be judged by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id=
      "page202"></a>{202}</span> usual standards, his genius is
      exceptional, intensely individual in all its forms and methods,
      belongs to the very extreme of the romantic as distinguished from
      the classical in art. He makes use of the violin and of the
      orchestra, in short of music, simply and mainly to impress his
      own personal moods, his own personal experience, upon the
      audiences. You go to hear Ole Bull, rather than to hear and feel
      his music. It is eminently a personal matter.... Considered
      simply as an executive power, he seems, after hearing so many
      good violinists for years past, to exceed them all&mdash;always
      excepting Henri Vieuxtemps."
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be said with truth that Ole Bull achieved his reputation
      at a time when it was comparatively easy to do so. There was very
      little musical cultivation in this country when he first appeared
      here, as may be easily imagined by a glance at the extracts from
      criticisms, given here and there. By his<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>{203}</span> strong
      personality, apparent mastery of his instrument, and by being
      practically the sole occupant of the field, he became famous and
      popular. He prided himself on the fact that his playing was
      addressed rather to the hearts than to the sensitive ears of his
      audiences, and during his later years he adopted certain
      mannerisms by way of distracting attention from his somewhat
      imperfect performances. He never made any pretension to being a
      musician of the modern school, nor of any regularly recognised
      school of music, but his concert pieces were his own
      compositions, of no great merit, and he still more delighted his
      audiences by playing national airs as no one had ever played them
      before. He was a minstrel rather than a musician in the broad
      sense of the word, but he held the hearts of the people as few,
      if any, minstrels had previously done.

      One of the most noticeable features of the biography of the
      violin virtuoso is that he invariably displays great talent at an
      early age and plays in public at any time from eight to twelve
      years old. There are doubtless more who do this than are ever
      heard of at a later day, for the idea of the infant phenomenon is
      alluring. The way of the violinist is hard. He has many years of
      study and self-denial before him, if he is to excel as a
      musician. Therefore the infant who can be exploited in such a
      manner as to make money provides for his future education, unless
      hard work or flattery kill him physically or intellectually
      before he is ripe. Many prodigies sink into oblivion,&mdash;some
      few rise<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id=
      "page205"></a>{205}</span> to celebrity. It will be noticed that
      the violinists who played in public while very young have
      invariably settled down afterward to serious study, and at a more
      mature age have thus been able to take their place in the musical
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Year by year, too, the demands upon the violinist have been
      greater. A virtuoso is judged rather by the standard of
      Beethoven's concerto than by his ability to perform musical
      gymnastics with operatic selections. Nevertheless, it is a fact
      that many of the best known violinists were those who catered to
      the taste of the multitude, while many better musicians have been
      comparatively unknown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among celebrated violinists few have led more romantic or
      adventurous lives than Edouard Remenyi, whose name is not yet
      forgotten in this country. Born at Hewes, in Hungary, in 1830, he
      possessed the restless spirit of his race, fought in the
      insurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id=
      "page206"></a>{206}</span> of 1848, escaped to the United States
      when the insurrection was crushed, but was received into favour
      again a few years later, on his return to his native land.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his twelfth to his fifteenth year he studied the violin at
      the Vienna Conservatoire under Böhm, who was also the teacher of
      Joachim. In 1848 he became adjutant to the distinguished General
      Görgey, and fought under Kossuth and Klapka in the war with
      Austria. Then came the flight to America, where he made a tour as
      a virtuoso, but in 1853 he visited Weimar, and sought out Franz
      Liszt, who at once recognised his genius and became his friend
      and guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1854 he went to London and was appointed solo violinist in the
      queen's band, but when in 1860 he obtained his amnesty and
      returned to Hungary he was created solo violinist in the band of
      the Emperor of Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      His restless disposition would not allow him to remain long in
      one place, and in 1865<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id=
      "page207"></a>{207}</span> he once more began to travel. He
      visited Paris, where he created a perfect furore, and then
      continued his triumphant course through Germany, Holland, and
      Belgium. After settling in Paris for about two years, he returned
      in 1877 to London, where he repeated his Parisian successes,
      appearing, as in Paris, chiefly in the salons of wealthy patrons.
      During this visit to London he appeared in public only once, at
      Mapleson's benefit at the Crystal Palace, when he played a
      fantasia on themes from the "Huguenots." The following year he
      went once more to the United States, and on his way played at the
      promenade concerts in London. In America he remained for some
      years, and then proceeded in 1887 to the Cape of Good Hope and
      Madagascar. While on this voyage it was reported that his ship
      was wrecked and that he was drowned, and numerous obituary
      notices of him appeared in the newspapers throughout the
      world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id=
      "page208"></a>{208}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1891 he was once more in London, and played at the house of
      the late Colonel North, "the Nitrate King." He now returned to
      the United States, where he passed the remainder of his days. His
      powers were, however, failing, and other violinists had brought
      new and perhaps higher interest to American audiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Remenyi visited the United States in 1878, he arrived a few
      weeks after Wilhelmj, and notwithstanding the fact that the two
      violinists were widely different in temperament, ideas,
      musicianship, in fact in every particular, they were frequently
      made the subjects of comparison. At this time Remenyi played an
      "Otello Fantaisie," "Suwanee River," "Grandfather's Clock," etc.
      He was well sketched in a journal of the time, which said:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Remenyi is gifted with a vivacious, generous, rather mocking
      disposition which rebels against monotony, and whose originality
      shines through everything, and in spite of everything. He is
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id=
      "page209"></a>{209}</span> fluent in five or six languages, and
      entertains with droll conceits, or with reminiscences of famous
      artists and composers.... In the wild rhythms of the gypsy dance,
      in the fierce splendour of the patriotic hymn, the player and
      audience alike are fired with excitement. The passion rises, the
      tumult waxes furious; a tremendous sweep of the bow brings the
      music to an end; and then we can say that we have heard Remenyi."
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The gypsy dance and the patriotic hymn! And yet he was weighed in
      the balance with Wilhelmj, who played the grandest and best music
      in the most refined, musicianly manner, and whose tour in America
      marked an epoch in the musical life of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his prime Remenyi was the master of an enormous technique, and
      the possessor of a strongly pronounced poetic individuality. His
      whole soul was in his playing, and his impulse carried him away
      with it as he warmed to his task, and it carried the audience
      too. His greatest success was in the<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>{210}</span> playing
      of Hungarian music, some of which he adapted for his instrument,
      but the stormier pieces of Chopin which he arranged for the
      violin were given by him with tremendous effect. In the more
      tender pieces, such as the nocturnes of Field and of Chopin, he
      played with the utmost dreaminess.
    </p>
    <p>
      His individuality showed in his playing. He was impulsive and
      uncertain,&mdash;a wandering musician, who, when the whim took
      him, would disappear from public view altogether. When he made a
      success in any place his restless nature would not allow him to
      follow it up, so that when his prime was past, instead of having
      formed connections which should have lasted him for the rest of
      his life, he was still the wandering musician, but without the
      marvellous powers which he had wielded only a few years before.
    </p>
    <p>
      During his long career he toured Australia and almost all the
      islands of the Pacific, also<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page211" id="page211"></a>{211}</span> Java, China, and Japan;
      in fact, he went where few, if any, violinists of his ability had
      been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once upon a time the representative of a London newspaper went to
      interview Remenyi, and was surprised to find that the violinist
      was not only willing to tell him much, but even proposed
      questions which he should answer. He said that he had played in
      the 60's before the natives of South Africa, and had been
      shipwrecked, after which he had the pleasure of reading some very
      fine obituary notices. In New Zealand he found the Maoris
      perfectly reckless in their demand for encores, and instead of
      playing six pieces, as announced on his programmes, he frequently
      had to play sixteen.
    </p>
    <p>
      In South Africa he discovered thirty out of his collection of
      forty-seven old and valuable violins. Most of them were probably
      the property of the Huguenots, who after the edict of Nantes went
      to Holland and thence<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212" id=
      "page212"></a>{212}</span> to South Africa, to which place they
      were banished by the Dutch government.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was related by Remenyi that when he was a young man in
      Hamburg, in 1853, he was to appear at a fashionable soirée one
      night, but at the last moment his accompanist was too ill to
      play. Remenyi went to a music store and asked for an accompanist.
      The proprietor sent Johannes Brahms, then a lad of sixteen, who
      was struggling for existence and teaching for a very small sum.
      Remenyi and Brahms became so interested in each other that they
      forgot all about the soirée, and sat up till four the next
      morning chatting and playing together. Remenyi's negligence of
      his engagement resulted in the loss of any further business in
      Hamburg, and together with Brahms he set out for Hanover, giving
      concerts as they went, and thus earning sufficient funds to carry
      them on their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hanover they called upon Joachim,<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>{213}</span> who
      arranged for them to play before the court. After this they
      proceeded to the Altenberg to see Liszt, who received them
      warmly, and offered them a home. During all this time Brahms
      received little or no recognition, in spite of Remenyi's
      enthusiasm in his cause, neither did he find very much favour
      with Liszt, although the latter recognised his talent. He
      therefore returned to Hanover, where Joachim gave him a letter to
      Schumann, and it was Schumann's enthusiastic welcome and
      declaration that a new genius had arisen that established
      Brahms's reputation in musical circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remenyi said that Brahms, shortly after his arrival at the
      Altenberg, offended Liszt and his pupils by comfortably sleeping
      during one of the famous lessons, which were in the nature of a
      general class. This breach of manners Brahms justified on the
      score of being exhausted by his previous journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Remenyi, which occurred on<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>{214}</span> May 15,
      1898, created a sensation throughout the country. He had, after
      many misgivings, consented to appear in "vaudeville." The
      financial inducement was large, and he soothed his artistic
      conscience with the argument that his music would tend to elevate
      the vaudeville rather than that the vaudeville would tend to
      degrade him. It was at the Orpheus Theatre in San Francisco, and
      it was his first appearance. He played one or two selections, and
      being tremendously applauded, and correspondingly gratified, he
      returned and answered the encore with the well-known "Old Glory."
      He was in his best vein, and played as one inspired. The audience
      literally rose with him, leaving their seats in their excitement,
      and the applause lasted several minutes. He came forward, and in
      response to another burst of applause commenced to play Delibes's
      "Fizzicati." He had played but a few measures when he leaned over
      as if to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id=
      "page215"></a>{215}</span> speak to one of the musicians in the
      orchestra. He paused a moment, and then fell slowly forward on
      his face. One of the musicians caught him before he touched the
      stage, and thus prevented his rolling off. All was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      Remenyi left a widow, a son, and a daughter, who lived in New
      York. His health had been failing for some time, for in 1896, for
      the first time in thirty years, he had, while in Davenport, Iowa,
      been compelled to cancel all his engagements and rest. It is said
      that Remenyi's real name was Hoffmann.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name of Miska Hauser is seldom mentioned in these days, and
      yet it was once known all over the world. No virtuoso of his time
      travelled more extensively, and few created more enthusiasm than
      did Hauser. He was born in Pressburg, Hungary, in 1822, and
      became a pupil of Böhm and of Mayseder at Vienna, also of
      Kreutzer and Sechter. He is said to have acquired more of
      Mayse<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id=
      "page216"></a>{216}</span> der's elegant style and incisive tone
      than of the characteristics of his other teachers, but his talent
      was devoted to the acquisition of virtuoso effects, which appeal
      to the majority rather than to the most cultivated.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a boy of twelve Hauser made an extensive and successful
      concert tour. In 1840 he toured Europe, and ten years later went
      to London, and thence to the West Indies and the United States,
      where he made quite a sensation, and was a member of Jenny Lind's
      company. He afterwards visited San Francisco, where he got
      himself into difficulties on account of Lola Montes. Then he went
      to South America, visiting Lima, where passionate creoles
      languished for him, Santiago, where a set of fanatics excited the
      mob against him, declaring that he was charmed by the devil, and
      Valparaiso, where he suffered shipwreck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then proceeded to the Sandwich Islands, where he played before
      the royal family<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id=
      "page217"></a>{217}</span> and all the dusky nobles. They
      listened solemnly, but made no sign of approbation, and Hauser
      felt that he was sinking into a mere nothing in their esteem. In
      desperation he tore the strings from his violin and played, with
      all his power, several sentimental songs on the G string only.
      Then he gave them Paganini's witches' dance. This succeeded, and
      they gave a yell of joy and wanted more. They particularly
      delighted in harmonic effects, and before long were willing to do
      anything for the foreigner who could pipe on the wood as well as
      any bird. He became a hero at Otaheite, but was obliged to
      continue on his journey. He next visited Australia, and while in
      Sydney he made such a success that he was presented with the
      freedom of the city and thanked by the government for his
      playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1860 he reached Turkey, where he played before the Sultan, who
      beat time to his music and seemed highly delighted.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>{218}</span> Hauser
      had many amusing stories to tell of his travels, and especially
      of his experiences in the Sandwich Islands and Turkey, Cairo and
      Alexandria. His adventures, which were numerous and thrilling,
      were published in two volumes, in Vienna.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hauser was not the possessor of a great technique, but there was
      something characteristic and charming in his tone and mannerisms,
      which were especially pleasing to the fair sex. He was a man of
      restless, and, in some respects, dissatisfied nature. Some of his
      compositions are still to be found on concert programmes, and
      these he used to play exquisitely. Hauser lived in retirement in
      Vienna after concluding his travels, and in 1887 he died
      practically forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few violinists succeeded more completely in captivating their
      audiences than Henri Wieniawski, whose impetuous Slavonic
      temperament, with its warm and tender feeling, gave a colour to
      his playing, which placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"
      id="page219"></a>{219}</span> his hearers entirely under his
      control, went straight to their hearts, and enlisted their
      sympathy from the very first note. Both fingering and bowing were
      examples of the highest degree of excellence in violin technique,
      and difficulties did not exist for him. At times his fiery
      temperament may have led him to exaggeration, and to a step
      beyond the bounds of good taste, but this was lost sight of in
      the peculiar charm of his playing, its gracefulness and piquancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wieniawski's tour in America, which took place in 1872, when he
      accompanied Rubinstein, may be said to mark an era in the musical
      life of this nation. These two great artists revealed the
      possibilities of the musical art to a people who, while loving
      music, were still in their infancy as far as musical development
      is concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wieniawski, like nearly all the great performers, showed his
      talent while very young. He was born in 1835 at Lublin, in
      Poland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id=
      "page220"></a>{220}</span> where his father was a medical man. He
      was taken to Paris by his mother when he was only eight years
      old, and he entered the Conservatoire, where he soon joined
      Massart's class, and when only eleven gained the first prize for
      violin playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this he made a concert tour in Poland and Russia, but soon
      returned to Paris to renew his studies, especially composition.
      In 1850 he went again on the road, and with his brother Joseph, a
      pianist, he gave concerts in most of the principal towns in the
      Netherlands, France, England, and Germany. In 1860 he was
      appointed solo violinist to the Emperor of Russia, and held that
      position for twelve years, residing chiefly at St. Petersburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the conclusion of this engagement that he made his tour
      in the United States with Rubinstein, who was his intimate
      friend, and when the great pianist returned to Europe Wieniawski
      remained in America<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id=
      "page221"></a>{221}</span> and succeeded in making a large
      fortune, travelling all over the country and creating a furore by
      his performances. This tour was cut short toward the end of 1874
      by a telegram from Brussels offering him the position of
      professor of violin at the Conservatoire, during the illness of
      Vieuxtemps.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained in Brussels until 1877, when, Vieuxtemps becoming
      convalescent, Wieniawski set forth once more on his travels.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time his health was failing, and an incident took place
      at Berlin which is well worth recording. During a concert he was
      seized with a sudden spasm, and was compelled to stop in the
      middle of a concerto. Joachim was amongst the audience, and came
      to the rescue, taking up Wieniawski's violin and finishing the
      programme, thus showing his friendship for the sufferer and
      earning the enthusiastic applause of an appreciative audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding his sufferings, Wieniawski<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>{222}</span>
      continued his tour, but at Odessa he broke down altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been stated that he died unknown and friendless in the
      hospital at Moscow, and was buried by public charity; but his
      son, Jules Wieniawski, has contradicted this, and states that he
      died in the house of the Countess of Meek, and was buried by the
      Czar Alexander III., of whom he was the friend as well as the
      favourite violinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wieniawski was a man of somewhat enthusiastic nature, and his
      actions were not always tempered by the most perfect wisdom. It
      was said that just before his marriage to Miss Hampton he took a
      run up the Rhine, not, like a wise man, waiting until he had some
      one to take proper care of him. The consequence was that he must
      just take an hour's look into Wiesbaden to see several old
      friends, and this led naturally to passing an idle moment looking
      at the green table doings. Here the excitement became too great
      for<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id=
      "page223"></a>{223}</span> one of his temperament, and he felt
      compelled to stake a small sum. A small sum led to a larger
      amount, and when he left the place he was poorer to the tune of
      forty thousand francs, and he came away to his bride a sadder and
      wiser man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although a great gambler, Wieniawski owed the loss of a large
      part of his fortune to the failure of a New York banking firm in
      1873, rather than to his favourite propensity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friendship between him and Vieuxtemps was very strong, in
      fact it was described as being ideal. Once, while Wieniawski was
      playing at a concert, Vieuxtemps was among the audience, and, at
      the conclusion of one of the violinist's solos, Vieuxtemps
      called, at the top of his voice, "Bravo, Wieniawski!" This drew
      attention to Vieuxtemps, who was immediately recognised by the
      audience and enthusiastically welcomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wieniawski's compositions number two and<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>{224}</span> twenty.
      As a proof of the old adage that "doctors do not always agree,"
      we are told by one excellent authority that his D minor concerto,
      the two polonaises, and his "Legende" will probably never vanish
      from the violinist's repertoire, and by another that Wieniawski's
      compositions are not of much importance. Both statements are no
      doubt true, for there are many fascinating concert pieces which,
      from the strictly classical point of view, are not important
      additions to musical literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      An American critic wrote of him, after his first appearance: "In
      Wieniawski we have the greatest violinist who has yet been heard
      in America.... Of all now living Joachim alone can claim
      superiority over him."
    </p>
    <p>
      This sweeping enthusiasm was not universal, for a critic more
      difficult to please wrote as follows: "Wieniawski's playing is as
      perfect as a faultless technique, artistic culture, great
      aesthetic sensibility, and perfect mastery over himself and his
      instrument can make it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"
      id="page225"></a>{225}</span> But with all its perfection we
      cannot but feel that the great original, heaven-and-earth-moving
      master-soul is wanting."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was also severely scathed by a critic in New York in 1872, who
      wrote: "Some people like pure, clear tone,&mdash;others don't.
      Those who admire scratching and false stopping, together with
      sundry other things of the same nature, would have experienced
      wild joy upon hearing Beethoven's "Violin Concerto" as it was
      played by Wieniawski; but for those who regard a correct
      intonation as a thing of primal importance, it could not have
      been pleasing. Wieniawski belongs to that school of which Ole
      Bull is a prominent member, whose first article of belief is that
      genuine passion and fervour is signified by rasping the strings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other criticisms of the same concert, however, were of a very
      different tenor, and when, a week or two later, Wieniawski played
      the same concerto in Boston, John S. Dwight<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>{226}</span> praised
      the performance highly, and took occasion to specially record his
      disagreement with the eminent critic in New York.
    </p>
    <p>
      While not technically the equal of one or two of his
      contemporaries, Wieniawski played with so much fire, and knew so
      well how to reach the heart of his audience by methods perfectly
      legitimate, that he must be ranked among the greatest violinists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Don Pablo Martin Meliton de Sarasate is a name known throughout
      Europe and America, if not throughout the civilised world.
      Sarasate was born in Spain, in Pampeluna, the chief city of
      Navarre. He was a youthful prodigy, and played before the court
      of Madrid at the age of ten, when Queen Isabella was so delighted
      with him that she presented him with a fine Stradivarius violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of years later he was sent to Paris, where he entered
      the Conservatoire, and was admitted into Alard's class, while M.
      Lassabathie, who was then administrator<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>{227}</span> of the
      institution, took him into his house and boarded him. This
      arrangement continued until the death, about ten years later, of
      M. Lassabathie.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of a year after entering the Conservatoire,
      Sarasate won the first prize for violin playing. From the first
      he manifested remarkable facility in mechanical execution, and
      his playing was distinguished for elegance and delicacy, though
      nothing indicated that his talent would become extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      For ten years after gaining the prize Sarasate remained a salon
      violinist, of amiable disposition, a ladies' virtuoso, with a
      somewhat mincing style, who played only variations on opera
      motives, and who was an entire stranger to classical music.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came a complete change; the character of his playing
      becoming serious, a large and noble style replaced the mincing
      manner which he had previously affected, and, instead<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>{228}</span> of the
      showy trifles which had filled his repertoire, he took to the
      works of the great masters. By hard work he developed his
      technical ability, so that he reached the limit beyond which few,
      if any, violinists succeed in passing. And all this he
      accomplished without losing anything of the elegance of his
      phrasing or of the infinite charm of his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Sarasate made Paris his home, he began to travel as
      early as 1859, and in 1872, when he played in Paris, he was
      welcomed as a new star. When his prestige was well established in
      Paris his friends advised him to go to Germany, but he feared
      that so soon after the Franco-German war he, who by long
      residence was practically a Frenchman, would not be welcome. At
      last, however, the entreaties of his friends prevailed, and when
      Sarasate appeared at Leipzig he produced an immense sensation.
      Then followed a series of tours in Germany, Russia,<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>{229}</span>
      Austria, England, and Belgium, which lasted three years, and
      brought him much glory and pecuniary gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Vienna the celebrated critic, Hanslick, wrote of him as
      follows: "There are few violinists whose playing gives such
      unalloyed enjoyment as the performance of this Spaniard. His tone
      is incomparable,&mdash;not powerfully or deeply affecting, but of
      enchanting sweetness. The infallible correctness of the player
      contributes greatly to the enjoyment. The moment the bow touches
      the Stradivarius a stream of beautiful sound flows toward the
      hearer. A pure tone seems to me the prime quality of violin
      playing&mdash;unfortunately, also, it is a rare quality.
      Sarasate's virtuosity shines and pleases and surprises the
      audience continually. He is distinguished, not because he plays
      great difficulties, but because he plays with them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both in France and Germany Sarasate has always been a great
      favourite, and is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"
      id="page230"></a>{230}</span> sure of a large and enthusiastic
      audience, even though he has passed the zenith of his powers. He
      has never taken pupils, but has confined himself to concert
      playing only, and he has been called the highest-priced player in
      Germany, where it was said that he received three thousand marks
      for a concert, while even Joachim received only one thousand. He
      has received many valuable gifts during his career, and these he
      has presented to his native city, Pampeluna, where they have been
      placed in a museum by the municipal council. The collection
      includes articles of great worth from the Emperor William I. of
      Germany, Napoleon III., the Emperor of Brazil, and the Queen of
      Spain, and its value is estimated at one hundred thousand francs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sarasate has visited the United States twice, and won great
      favour, for his playing is of the kind which appeals to the
      fancy, graceful, vivacious, and pure toned, and he<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>{231}</span> plays
      Spanish dances in a manner never to be surpassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has been compared with some of the most eminent violinists
      thus:&mdash;Vieuxtemps was an artist with an ardent mind, and a
      magnificent interpreter of Beethoven; Joachim towers aloft in the
      heights of serene poetry, upon the Olympic summits inaccessible
      to the tumults of passion; Sivori was a dazzling virtuoso;
      Sarasate is an incomparable charmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are doubtless many who remember the tour of August
      Wilhelmj, the celebrated violinist, who visited the United States
      about twenty years ago. He was considered second to no artist
      then living in his general command over the resources of his
      instrument, and he excelled in the purity and volume of his tone,
      no less than in the brilliancy of his execution. He did not
      possess the warmth and impulsiveness which constituted the charm
      of Wieniawski, but his perform<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page232" id="page232"></a>{232}</span> ances appealed to his
      audiences in a different and more legitimate manner. He was even
      a greater traveller than Remenyi, and visited almost, if not
      quite, every civilised country. His travels took him throughout
      Europe, America, Australia, and Asia. He was, in 1885, invited by
      the Sultan of Turkey to perform in his seraglio, the only
      violinist to whom such a compliment had ever been paid. The
      Sultan on this occasion decorated him with the Order of the
      Medjidie, second class, and presented him with some beautiful
      diamonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      August Wilhelmj was born in 1845 at Usingen, in the Duchy of
      Nassau, and, showing his aptitude, was placed under Konrad
      Fischer, a violinist of Wiesbaden, at the age of six. His
      progress was so rapid that when nine years old he played in a
      concert in Limburg and received great applause. Wilhelmj's father
      was a lawyer of distinction and a wealthy vine-grower, and, in
      spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id=
      "page233"></a>{233}</span> the boy's progress, he did not favour
      the idea of allowing him to take to the violin as a profession,
      for he felt that the majority of infant prodigies fail as they
      reach manhood. But the boy had received much encouragement, and
      persisted in his desire. Henrietta Sontag, the celebrated singer,
      heard him play Spohr's ninth concerto and "The Carnival of
      Venice," and was so charmed that she said he would become the
      German Paganini.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the course of time Wilhelmj succeeded in obtaining a
      concession from his father:&mdash;he was to get the judgment of a
      musical authority on his capabilities, and, if favourable, no
      objection should be made to his becoming a virtuoso. On the
      recommendation of Prince Emil of Wittgenstein, the young
      violinist went in 1861 to Liszt at Weimar, and after playing to
      him Spohr's "Scena Cantante" and the Hungarian fantasia by Ernst,
      he was asked to play several pieces at sight. At the end of this
      trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id=
      "page234"></a>{234}</span> Liszt sprang from his seat, calling
      out in a loud voice, "Ay! indeed you are predestinated to become
      a violinist&mdash;so much so that for you the violin must have
      been invented if it had not already existed." This judgment
      satisfied the father, and a few days later Liszt himself took the
      boy to Leipzig and introduced him to Ferdinand David, saying,
      "Let me present to you a future Paganini. Look well to him!" For
      three years Wilhelm; was a pupil of David, and at the same time
      studied the theory of music with Richter and Hausmann. In due
      course he passed his examinations at the Leipzig Conservatory,
      playing Joachim's Hungarian concerto.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1865 he began his concert tours, travelling through
      Switzerland and Holland to England, and from this time he seems
      to have been almost continually travelling. During 1869, 1870,
      and 1871 he made a long tour in England with Charles
      Santley,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id=
      "page235"></a>{235}</span> the great singer. In 1876 he led the
      violins at the Nibelungen performance at Bayreuth, and the Wagner
      concerts in London, at the Albert Hall, in 1877, were due to his
      representations. In 1882, after travelling all over the globe, he
      spent some time in Russia, but presently returned to Germany and
      established a violin school at Biberich, which, however, he
      abandoned after a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time he continued to play in public, but gradually
      withdrew and lived in retirement at Blasewitz, near Dresden.
      Eventually he went to London, where he was appointed professor at
      the Guildhall School of Music. Unfortunately, his powers have
      been on the wane for some years past, but though the days of his
      public performances are past, he is known as a most patient and
      painstaking teacher. The high esteem in which he has been held
      was quaintly expressed by an eminent musician, who referred to
      his decadence in these words: "Ah, if<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>{236}</span>
      Wilhelmj had not been what he <i>is</i>, Joachim would never have
      been what <i>he</i> is." By which one may infer that Wilhelmj
      was, in some respects, a greater man than Joachim.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1894 Wilhelmj married Marcella Mausch-Jerret, of Dresden, a
      distinguished pianist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wilhelmj's first appearance in America took place on September
      26, 1878, in New York, and his playing caused an unusual
      demonstration. He was described in the following words: "His
      figure is stately, his face and attitude suggest reserve force
      and that majestic calm which seems to befit great power.... A
      famous philosopher once said that beauty consists of an exact
      balance between the intellect and the imagination. The violin
      performance of Wilhelmj exhibits this just proportion more
      perfectly than the work of any other artist of whom we have
      personal knowledge. Wilhelmj himself has said, 'After all, what
      the people want is intel<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"
      id="page237"></a>{237}</span> lectual playing,' that is, playing
      with a clear under standing."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither his character nor his playing was of such a nature as to
      appeal to the great mass of people in the way in which Remenyi
      and Ole Bull won their hearts. Wilhelmj was massive in person and
      in tone. He stood for dignity in his actions, appearance, and
      playing, and was honoured by the more cultivated and educated
      portion of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is regarded by musicians as one of the greatest violinists who
      ever visited America, and at the present day visiting artists are
      spoken of as "one of the best since Wilhelmj," or, "not to be
      compared with Wilhelmj," and by many Ysaye is regarded as "the
      best&mdash;since Wilhelmj."

    <p>
      Martin Pierre Joseph Marsick, who was born at Jupille, near
      Liège, on March 9, 1848, is one of the foremost solo and quartet
      violinists of the day, with a remarkable technique and admirable
      intelligence, power, and fire.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page238" id="page238"></a>{238}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When eight years of age he was placed at the music school at
      Liège, where in two years he gained the first prize in the
      preparatory classes. In 1864 he secured the gold medal, which is
      awarded only to pupils of extraordinary talent.

    <p>
      He now entered the Brussels Conservatoire, where his expenses
      were met by a lady who was a musical enthusiast, and he studied
      for two years under Léonard, working at the same time in
      composition under Kufferath. In 1868 he went to Paris, where he
      studied for a season under Massart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1870 Marsick proceeded to Berlin, where, through the
      instrumentality of a government subvention, he was enabled to
      study under Joachim. After that he began to travel, and soon
      acquired a great reputation. He was said to equal, if not exceed,
      Sarasate in the wonderful celerity of his scales, and in
      lightness and certainty. His tone is not very full, but is sweet
      and clear. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id=
      "page239"></a>{239}</span> His playing is also marked by
      exceptional smoothness, scholarly phrasing, and graceful
      accentuation, but, in comparison with some of the other great
      players, he lacks breadth and passion. He appeals rather to the
      educated musician than to the general public, and for that reason
      many people were somewhat disappointed when he played in the
      United States in 1896. He was compared with Ysaye, a player of an
      entirely different stamp, and he suffered in popular estimation
      by the comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this period also belong a number of excellent violinists whose
      names are seldom heard in America. Edmund Singer, a Hungarian,
      born in 1831, by dint of hard work and talent reached a high
      position. He became celebrated as a teacher, and was for years
      professor of violin at the conservatory in Stuttgart. He was also
      largely instrumental in the establishment of the Musical Artists'
      Society of that place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id=

    </p>
    <p>
      Ferdinand Laub was a virtuoso of high rank who was born in Prague
      in 1832. He succeeded Joachim at Weimar, but two years later
      became violin teacher at the Stern-Marx conservatory in Berlin,
      also concert-master of the royal orchestra and chamber virtuoso.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heinrich Karl de Ahna was an excellent artist, and was for some
      years second violin in the famous Joachim quartet. At the age of
      fourteen he had already made a successful concert tour, and
      become chamber virtuoso to the Duke of Coburg-Gotha. He then
      abandoned the musical profession and entered the army, fighting
      in the Italian campaign as lieutenant. After the war he returned
      to his profession, and became leader of the royal band in Berlin
      and professor at the Hochschule. He died in 1892.

    <p>
      Russia also produced an excellent violinist, Wasil Wasilewic
      Besekirskij, who was born at Moscow, and after a career as
      vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id=

      to his native city. He is the composer of some good violin music
      and has formed some excellent pupils, of whom Gregorowitsch is
      perhaps best known.

    <p>
      In England, John Tiplady Carrodus and the Holmes brothers
      attained high rank. Carrodus was a native of Keighley, Yorkshire.
      His father was a barber, and it was only by the most constant
      self-denial and incessant hard work that the boy succeeded in
      securing his education. He walked with his father twelve miles in
      order to hear Vieuxtemps play, and to take his lessons he walked
      each week ten miles to Bradford, usually getting a ride back in
      the carrier's cart. He became a pupil of Molique, and eventually
      one of the best known violinists of England, where his character
      as a man was always highly respected.

      Alfred Holmes was born in 1837 and his brother Henry in 1839.

      1847, but immediately withdrew from public life and continued
      their studies for six more years. In 1853 they again appeared in
      London, and then made a long concert tour through the north of
      Europe. Finally they settled in Paris, where, nine years later,
      Alfred died. Henry Holmes became the chief professor of violin at
      the Royal College of Music in London, and has been also active as
      a composer and editor of violin works.

      Jacob Grün, too, who was born in 1837 at Buda-Pesth, and who,
      after a career as concert soloist in Europe, became a teacher in

      JOACHIM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Joachim is one of the musical giants of the nineteenth
      century. He will be remembered as one whose life has been
      interwoven with the lives of the greatest musicians of his day,
      as one of the greatest educators in his line who ever lived, and
      as the embodiment of the purest and highest ideas in public
      performance.

      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Joachim is called the greatest violinist of modern times, and no
      better words can be found to describe his characteristics than
      those of Wasielewski, who says: "Joachim's incomparable violin
      playing is the true <i>chef-d'oeuvre</i>, the ideal of a perfect
      violinist (so far as we present-day critics can judge). Less
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id=
      "page245"></a>{245}</span> cannot, dare not be said, but, at the
      same time, more cannot be said of him or of any one, and it is
      enough. But that which raises him above all other contemporary
      violinists and musicians generally is the line he takes in his
      professional life. He is no virtuoso in the ordinary sense, for
      he is far more,&mdash;before all he will be a musician. And that
      he unquestionably is,&mdash;a magnificent example to young
      people, who are to some extent possessed of the demon of vanity,
      of what they should do and what they should leave undone. Joachim
      makes music, and his preëminent capabilities are directed toward
      the serving one true, genuine art, and he is right."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim was born on June 28, 1831, in the village of Kittsee, in
      Hungary, within the small radius which has produced three other
      great musicians,&mdash;Haydn, Hummel, and Liszt. He began to
      study the violin when he was five years old, and was
      placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id=
      "page246"></a>{246}</span> under Servaczinski, leader of the
      opera orchestra at Pesth. In two years he made his first public
      appearance at a concert at Pesth, when he played a duet concerto
      for two violins and orchestra with his master, and a solo on a
      theme by Schubert, with variations. He was now (1841) sent to
      Vienna, where he entered the conservatoire and studied under Böhm
      for two years. At the end of this time he went to Leipzig, where
      he met with Mendelssohn and played in a concert of Madame
      Viardot's. A few months later he appeared as a finished artist in
      a Gewandhaus concert, and played Ernst's "Otello Fantasie."
      Leipzig was then, under Mendelssohn's guidance, in the zenith of
      its fame, and for a boy of twelve to appear in a Gewandhaus
      concert and earn, not only the applause of the audience, but also
      the praise of the critics, was something very unusual. But a
      still greater honour was in store for him,&mdash;the following
      year he took part, in a Gewand<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page247" id="page247"></a>{247}</span> haus concert, in a
      concertante for four violins by Maurer, the other performers
      being Ernst, Bazzini, and David, all violinists of renown and
      very much his seniors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim remained in Leipzig until 1850, studying with Ferdinand
      David, while Hauptmann gave him instruction in composition,
      though during this time he occasionally travelled in Germany and
      elsewhere to play in concerts. Thus in 1844 Mendelssohn brought
      him to England, where he played in public for the first time at a
      benefit concert of Mr. Bunn's at Drury Lane, in March, 1844, and
      in May of the same year he appeared at the fifth Philharmonic
      concert and played Beethoven's concerto with very great success.
      In this year two other violinists of note made their first
      appearance at the Philharmonic concerts,&mdash;Ernst and Sainton,
      also Piatti, the great violoncellist. Joachim visited England
      again in 1847, and since that time so frequently that he became
      one of the regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id=
      "page248"></a>{248}</span> features of musical life in that
      country, where he has been so highly honoured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim's first appearance in Paris was made in 1849, when he
      spent two months in that city, and began his successes by playing
      in an orchestral concert given by Hector Berlioz. About this time
      Franz Liszt, who had heard of Joachim's rapidly increasing
      reputation, invited him to go to Weimar and lead the orchestra
      which he conducted. Joachim accepted the invitation and remained
      in Weimar two years. He could never be brought to see the beauty
      of the new school of music, and while he recognised the
      extraordinary gifts, and admired the personality and brilliant
      qualities of Liszt, he could not be prevailed upon to remain in
      Weimar longer than two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1854 he accepted the post of conductor and solo violinist to
      the King of Hanover, a position which he retained for twelve
      years, during which time he enhanced his reputa<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>{249}</span> tion as
      a musician, and married Amalia Weiss, a celebrated contralto
      singer. In 1866 the troubles which enveloped Germany brought
      Joachim's engagement in Hanover to an end, but two years later he
      entered upon what has proved to be the most important part of his
      career, when he was appointed professor of violin at the
      Hochschule for music in Berlin. This school was a new branch of
      the already existing Academy of Arts, and was to be a high school
      for musical execution, as apart from composition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim threw his whole heart into the new work before him, and
      the branch of the school under his direction soon rivalled any
      similar school. Various branches were added to the
      school,&mdash;in 1871 a class for organ, in 1872 classes for
      brass instruments, double-bass, and solo vocalists, in 1873 a
      chorus class. In 1875 the Royal Academy of Arts was reorganised
      and became the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id=
      "page250"></a>{250}</span> Royal High School for Music, with
      Joachim as director. That Joachim had earned a very high position
      as early as 1859 is shown by an extract from the <i>Musical
      World</i> of London, in that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long as virtuosi walked (or galloped) in their proper sphere,
      they amused by their mechanical <i>tours de force</i>, charmed by
      their <i>finesse</i> and did no great harm to musical taste. They
      were accepted <i>cum grano salis</i>, applauded for their
      dexterity, and admired for the elegance with which they were able
      to elaborate thoughts in themselves of every slight artistic
      worth. But recently our 'virtuosi' have been oppressed with a
      notion that, to succeed in this country, they must invade and
      carry by storm the 'classics' of the art, instead of adhering
      exclusively as of old to their own fantasies and <i>jeux de
      marteaux</i>. One composition after another by the great masters
      is seized upon and worried.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page251" id="page251"></a>{251}</span> If they were things of
      flesh and blood, and could feel the gripe, be conscious of the
      teeth, and appreciate the fangs of these rapid-devouring
      'virtuosi,' concertos, sonatas, trios, etc., would indeed be in a
      pitiable condition. Happily, being of the spirit, they bleed not,
      but are immortal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One great result attending Herr Joachim's professional visit to
      London is, that it enables both professors and amateurs
      opportunity after opportunity of studying <i>his</i> manner of
      playing the works of the giants of music. <i>How</i> Herr Joachim
      executes these compositions&mdash;how differently from the
      self-styled 'virtuosi,' how purely, how modestly, how wholly
      forgetful of himself in the text he considers it an honour being
      allowed to interpret to the crowd&mdash;we need scarcely remind
      our readers. Not a single eccentricity of carriage or demeanour,
      not a moment of egotistical display, to remind his hearers that,
      although Beethoven is being played, it<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page252" id="page252"></a>{252}</span> is
      Joachim who is playing, ever escapes this truly admirable and (if
      words might be allowed to bear their legitimate signification)
      most accomplished of 'virtuosi.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      As an example of Joachim's conscientiousness, the following
      little anecdote will serve to give an idea. Joachim once
      introduced into the <i>point d'orgue</i> of Beethoven's concerto
      a cadence terminated by a <i>trait en octave</i>, which caused an
      extraordinary effect. People spoke only of this cadence; it was
      the event of the evening wherever he played. This success wounded
      his feelings of artistic probity; he considered it unbecoming
      that people should be more taken up with the skill of the
      executant than with the beauties of the music, and the cadence
      was suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the many years of his connection with the Hochschule,
      Joachim's personal influence has been exerted upon a large number
      of pupils, in fact almost every well-known<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>{253}</span> violin
      player has been to Berlin to seek his advice and instruction, and
      the players he has perfected are almost without number. Many
      anecdotes are told concerning his kindness to his pupils, but so
      greatly is he sought after that comparatively few of the hundreds
      who flock to Berlin are able to reach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim's early training and education developed his character
      both as a musician and as a man. The influence of Mendelssohn,
      whose friendship ended only with his death, of David, Schumann,
      Liszt, Berlioz, and Brahms, who was largely indebted to Joachim
      for the introduction of many of his works to the public, brought
      out the thorough uprightness, firmness of character and
      earnestness of purpose, and that intense dislike of all that is
      artificial or untrue in art, which have made him a great moral
      power in the musical world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He combines in a unique degree the highest executive powers with
      the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id=
      "page254"></a>{254}</span> excellent musicianship. Unsurpassed as
      a master of the instrument, he uses his powers of execution in
      the services of art, and represents the perfection of a pure
      style and legitimate school, with breadth and fidelity of
      interpretation. His performances undoubtedly derive their charm
      and merit from the strength of his talent and of his artistic
      character, and are stamped with a striking originality of
      conception; at the same time fidelity to the text, and careful
      endeavour to enter into the spirit and feeling of the composer,
      are the principles of executive art which Joachim has invariably
      practised.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the rendering of Bach's solos, Beethoven's concertos and
      quartets, he has no rival, and for the revival of many great
      works the musical world is indebted to him. Of these, one
      instance may be cited, viz., the violin concerto (Op. 61) of
      Beethoven, which was first played by Clement, December 23, 1806.
      This concerto bears evidence of having been<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>{255}</span> written
      in a hurry. Clement played it at sight without rehearsal, and, as
      a consequence of its being brought forward in such a slipshod
      manner, it was very seldom heard until its revival by Joachim.
      The MS. shows that the solo part was the object of much thought
      and alteration by the composer, but evidently after the first
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a composer, Joachim has contributed work of value to the
      literature of the violin. His "Hungarian Concerto" is a creation
      of real grandeur, built up in noble symphonic proportions. Most
      of his works are of a grave, somewhat melancholy character, and
      all of them are marked by earnestness of purpose and a high
      ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The jubilee of Joachim's life as a violin player was celebrated
      in Berlin with great ceremony and with unusual honour, and in
      England a demonstration was made in his honour by the public, who
      subscribed a sum<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256" id=
      "page256"></a>{256}</span> of about $6,000, with which was
      purchased an instrument of wonderful beauty, a celebrated "Red
      Strad," which was presented to him at a public meeting held at
      the conclusion of the Monday Popular Concerts, in 1888.
    </p>
    <p>
      This celebration was, however, quite eclipsed by that of the
      sixtieth anniversary of his first public appearance, which was
      held at Berlin on April 22, 1899. A grand concert was given at
      the Philharmonie, with an orchestra consisting of two hundred
      performers. There were ninety violins, thirty violas, twenty-one
      'celli, and twenty double-basses, and of these all except the
      double-basses had been pupils of Joachim, the violas and 'celli
      having been his pupils in chamber music. They had come from all
      over Europe to take part in the festival. Nearly half of the
      violins were concert-masters, and many of them famous soloists,
      as Carl Halir, Henri Petri, Jeno Hubay, Willy Hess, Gustav
      Hol<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id=
      "page257"></a>{257}</span> laender, Gabrielle Wietrowitz, Marie
      Soldat, and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim entered the hall at half-past six, and was greeted with a
      deafening fanfare played by the combined trumpeters of the
      military bands stationed in Berlin. The audience rose in a body
      and added its cheers to the noise of the trumpets. A large
      armchair, beautifully decorated with flowers and wreaths, was
      reserved as a seat of honour for the great musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seventh number on the programme was left vacant, but when it
      was reached the orchestra began the introduction to Beethoven's
      concerto. No soloist was in sight, but Gabrielle Wietrowitz and
      Marie Soldat, his most celebrated women pupils, came slowly down
      toward Joachim's chair, one carrying a violin and the other a
      bow, which they placed in his hands. Joachim, however, did not
      wish to play, and did not yield except under the force of
      persuasion, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id=
      "page258"></a>{258}</span> he said: "I have not had a violin in
      my hands for three days; I am in no mood to play; moreover, there
      are many in the orchestra who can play it better than I, but I
      don't want to refuse." So Joachim played the great concerto, and
      received an ovation such as had probably never been accorded to
      him before. Then he conducted Bach's concerto in G major for
      strings, which was played by sixty-six violins, fifty-seven
      violas, twenty-four 'celli, and twenty double-basses, and this
      brought the concert to a close.
    </p>
    <p>
      The concert was followed by a banquet at which there were eight
      hundred guests, and the festivities lasted until four o'clock the
      next morning. No violinist was ever more respected or beloved by
      his pupils, nor did one ever wield a more powerful influence in
      the musical world. To be put forward by Joachim gives one a high
      standing in the musical world to begin with, but<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>{259}</span> few
      indeed are those who receive this privilege in comparison with
      those who desire it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim is not a builder of technique or a teacher of beginners.
      Pupils who are accepted by him must be already proficient
      technicians, and it may be stated that the teacher who can
      prepare pupils for Joachim stands high in the profession. Joachim
      is a great adviser, a former of style, and a master of
      interpretation, to whom pupils flock two or three years too
      early, and feel aggrieved if they are not at once accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else can you do?" he once asked of a young man who desired
      to become a great violinist, and had sought Joachim's advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I would like to study for the ministry," was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is much better to be a good minister than a poor violinist,"
      said Joachim, looking him full in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      His liberality is proverbial, and after a<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>{260}</span> long
      and successful life, during which he has received high salaries,
      he is not rich. He seldom refuses to play gratis for any really
      worthy object, and the anecdotes of his kindness toward his
      pupils are without number.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few men have shone with such an even, steady lustre, through a
      long life. Others have come up, flourished, and sunk into
      oblivion, but the light of Joachim has shone steadily for more
      than sixty years, and as an interpreter of the classics he has
      never been excelled, and perhaps never will be.

    <p>
      VIOLINISTS OF TO-DAY.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these latter days the number of good violinists seems to have
      increased greatly. A season seldom passes without witnessing the
      début of some half-dozen aspirants for public approbation, but
      the great majority of them settle down into some special field of
      labour, and do not acquire world-wide fame as virtuosi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtuosity to-day depends very largely on the art of advertising.
      In the old days of Viotti and Spohr, the violinist would remain
      in a city for months, make acquaintances, and gradually acquire a
      reputation which would justify his giving some concerts.
      A<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id=
      "page262"></a>{262}</span> tour lasting from three to six years
      would cover a comparatively small amount of territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day the concert agent searches among the new lights for one or
      two who seem, in his judgment, likely to please the audiences to
      whom he caters, and who will justify the curiosity roused by the
      wholesale advertising done in their behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violinist is rushed from one place to another with mechanical
      precision, and flits from Maine to California and from Canada to
      the Gulf in a few short weeks. There are more soloists, more
      concerts, more musical organisations than ever before.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not follow by any means that the travelling virtuoso is
      one of the <i>greatest</i> violinists of his time. There are, in
      every city of Europe and in many cities of America, violinists
      who equal or even excel many of those who are exploited as
      virtuosi. The <i>great</i> violinists are not to be found
      every<span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id=
      "page263"></a>{263}</span> day. In the past twenty years,
      perhaps, not more than two can be recalled who have visited the
      United States as mature, great artists,&mdash;Wilhelmj and Ysaye.
      Many violinists of excellent ability have been heard, and to some
      of them some day the adjective <i>great</i> may be applied. The
      fact that they have devoted their energies to concert work, and
      have been favourably received by the most important musical
      organisations, makes them celebrated, but the word <i>great</i>
      can apply but to few.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adolf Brodsky, who came to America in 1892, and who is a
      violinist of much ability, with a beautiful tone, facile and
      brilliant technique, but somewhat lacking in elegance and polish,
      did not come to tour the country as a virtuoso. He was engaged by
      Mr. Walter Damrosch as concert-master for the New York orchestra,
      but during his stay in this country he appeared in many of the
      most important concerts, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page264" id="page264"></a>{264}</span> considered one of the
      best violinists who had ever come to live in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brodsky was born in 1851 at Taganrog, in Southern Russia, and was
      one of those who found his profession at the age of four, when he
      bought a violin at a fair, and began to pick out Russian
      folk-tunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For four years he was taught music at home, and made good
      progress. Then a wealthy gentleman was attracted by his talent,
      hearing him play at a concert at Odessa, and provided the funds
      necessary for him to go to Vienna and study under Hellmesberger.
      He became second violin in the celebrated Hellmesberger Quartet,
      and thus gained a great reputation as a quartet player.
    </p>
    <p>
      After travelling all over Europe for four years, he was appointed
      second professor of the violin at the Conservatory of Moscow,
      where he remained another four years. Then followed more study
      and more travel until, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"
      id="page265"></a>{265}</span> when Schradieck accepted the
      position of violin teacher at the Cincinnati conservatory,
      Brodsky was appointed to fill his place at Leipzig. In 1892 he
      was called to New York, but, owing to troubles which arose in the
      musical profession, he returned to Europe the following year,
      and, after a short sojourn in Berlin, received the appointment of
      director of the Royal College of Music at Manchester, England,
      where he succeeded Sir Charles Hallé.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emil Sauret is well known in America, for he visited the United
      States in 1872-73, and made a tour which was so successful, that
      it was repeated in 1874, when he travelled with Ilma di Murska,
      the great singer, and his wife, Teresa Careño, the pianist.
    </p>

      <p>
        <b>EMIL SAURET</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Sauret began his public career at the age of eight. He was born
      at Dun-le-Roi, in the department of Cher, in France, in 1852, and
      at the age of six entered the conservatory at<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>{266}</span>
      Strasburg, after some preliminary instruction at home. In two
      years he began his travels, and for several years he divided his
      time between study and travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a boy he was taken up by De Bériot, who was much interested in
      his welfare. He studied under Vieuxtemps in Paris, and in 1872
      was one of the artists engaged for the tour organised by the
      President of the French Republic for the relief of the sufferers
      by the Franco-German war.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1879 ne was appointed teacher at the Stern Conservatory in
      Berlin, a post which he relinquished on being offered the
      position made vacant in the Royal Academy of Music, London, by
      the death of Sainton.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Sauret is pronounced conservative and conscientious to the
      last degree in handling the classics, and, although he has great
      individuality, passion, and fire, he would consider it a
      sacrilege to obtrude his own personality upon the listener. He is
      distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id=
      "page267"></a>{267}</span> guished for elegance rather than
      perfection of technique. He may be considered a representative of
      the extreme French school.
    </p>
    <p>
      In temperament he is quick and somewhat impatient. He expects
      much of his pupils, and is the very opposite of the painstaking,
      phlegmatic Wilhelmj.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1896 M. Sauret again visited the United States, when it was
      admitted by those who had heard him twenty years before that he
      had grown to a consummate and astounding virtuoso. His tone was
      firm, pure, and beautiful, though not large. Marsick and Ondricek
      had preceded him by a few weeks, but Sauret did not suffer by
      comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most remarkable violinists of the present day is César
      Thomson, who was born at Liège in 1857. He entered the
      conservatory of his native place, after receiving some
      instruction from his father, and had completed the regular course
      by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id=
      "page268"></a>{268}</span> time he was twelve years of age, after
      which he became a pupil of Leonard.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the age of eighteen he made a concert tour through Italy, and
      while there became a member of the private orchestra of the Baron
      de Derwies. In 1879 he became a member of the Bilse Orchestra,
      and in 1882, having won distinction at the musical festival at
      Brussels, he was appointed professor of the violin in the Liège
      conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of his travelling has been done since that time, and he has
      acquired an immense reputation in Europe. In Leipzig, at a
      Gewandhaus concert in 1891, he made a phenomenal success, and in
      1898 at Brussels he received five enthusiastic recalls from a
      cold and critical audience, for his magnificent performance of
      the Brahms concerto.

      is so great that he can play the most terrific passages without
      sacrificing his tone or clearness of phras<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>{269}</span> ing,
      and his octave playing almost equals that of Paganini himself.
      Yet he is lacking in personal magnetism, and is a player for the
      musically cultivated rather than for the multitude, though his
      technique fills the listener with wonder. He visited the United
      States in 1896, and was, like Marsick, compared with Ysaye, who
      at that time swept everything before him and carried the country
      by storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1897 César Thomson left Liège, owing, it is said, to
      disagreements at the Conservatoire, and made his home at
      Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest of Belgian violinists of to-day is Eugene Ysaye, who
      possesses that magnetism which charms alike the musician and the
      amateur, because of his perfect musical expression. He possesses
      the inexplicable and inexpressible something which takes cold
      judgment off its feet and leads criticism captive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ysaye was born at Liège in 1858, and,<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>{270}</span> after
      studying at the conservatories of his native town under his
      father and at Brussels, entered that of Paris, where he completed
      the course in 1881, and immediately afterward started on a series
      of concert tours. Ysaye's eminence as a violinist has been gained
      by hard work. He did not burst meteor-like upon the world, but he
      earned his position in the violin firmament by ten years of
      concert touring, during which time he passed successively through
      the stages of extreme sentimentality until he reached the "sea"
      of real sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was in 1873 that Ysaye, after preparation given chiefly by his
      father, made his way to Brussels and sought out Wieniawski, then
      professor at the Conservatoire. Wieniawski was teaching, when a
      note was brought to him marked "private and important." The
      servant was told to show the bearer in, and Ysaye, then about
      fifteen years of age, timidly entered the room carry<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page271" id="page271"></a>{271}</span> ing his
      violin. After a little preliminary conversation which allowed the
      youth to tell his history, Wieniawski asked him what he would
      play, and in reply he placed on the piano desk a concerto of
      Vieuxtemps. The result of his performance was that he at once
      became a pupil of Wieniawski, with whom he remained some three
      years, during the period in which Vieuxtemps was recovering from
      his paralytic shock. In 1876 Vieuxtemps heard him at Antwerp, and
      through his influence the Belgian government was induced to grant
      Ysaye a stipend in order to allow him to pursue his studies at
      Paris. There he was the pupil of Massart, who had also been the
      teacher of Wieniawski, Ysaye's master at Brussels. Vieuxtemps is
      said to have expressed the desire, while in Algiers during his
      latter years, to have Ysaye stay with him to play his
      compositions, but Ysaye was at that time in St. Petersburg. When
      Vieuxtemps died and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page272" id=
      "page272"></a>{272}</span> his remains were brought to Verviers,
      his birthplace, Ysaye carried in the procession the violin and
      bow of the virtuoso on a black velvet cushion fringed with
      silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ysaye first appeared in America he was a mature artist, the
      recognised leader of the Belgian school of violinists, the first
      professor of violin at the Brussels Conservatoire, and the
      possessor of many decorations and honours bestowed upon him by
      various royalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had been in America a month he was acknowledged to be
      the greatest violinist who had visited this country for many
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man of large and powerful physique, he plays with a bold and
      manly vigour, and yet with exquisite delicacy. He is a master of
      phrasing and of all beauties of detail, has a wonderfully perfect
      technique, but that quality which places him at the head of all
      rivals is his musical feeling, his tem<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>{273}</span>
      perament. He has been compared to Rubinstein and to Paderewski.
      He inspires his hearers, or, as it was once expressed, very
      neatly, "he creeps up under your vest." He disarms criticism, and
      he seems to be more completely part of his violin and his violin
      of him than has been the case with any other player who has
      visited these shores for some years. He has given the greatest
      performance of the celebrated Bach chaconne ever heard in
      America. He has been declared to be not inferior to Joachim in
      his performance of this work, though he has not so broad a tone
      as the latter, nor as Wieniawski. He combines Sarasate's
      tenderness of tone and showy technique with more manliness and
      sincerity than Sarasate gives.
    </p>
    <p>
      The student, perhaps, can learn more from César Thomson than from
      Ysaye, but he will receive from the latter the greater
      inspiration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id=
      "page274"></a>{274}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Ysaye is noted, too, for sincerity of purpose and seriousness
      such as few of the virtuosi have possessed. He is free from all
      traits of charlatanism and trickery. Once, when in California, he
      was asked for an autograph copy of a few measures of his original
      cadenza to the Beethoven concerto (an embellishment which all
      violinists seem obliged to compose), but he declared that he did
      not like the idea of an original cadenza to Beethoven's work,
      that it was much better to omit it, as it formed no part of the
      concerto. "In original cadenzas by virtuosi," he said, "we find
      too much violin and too little music," for which confession from
      such an artist the world may be truly grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ysaye came to America in 1894 he was prepared with a
      repertoire consisting of ninety-one pieces. Of these, fourteen
      were concertos, seventeen sonatas, and eleven were compositions
      of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a second tour in America in<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page275" id="page275"></a>{275}</span> 1898, when he confirmed
      the opinions already formed as to his wonderful qualities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, 1899, he went to Berlin, which city he had not visited
      for several years, and appeared as soloist of the tenth Nikisch
      Philharmonic concert, when he played the E major concerto by
      Bach, and scored an overwhelming success. At the end of the
      concert he was recalled some fifteen times, and had completely
      exploded the idea so firmly held in Berlin, that the Belgians
      cannot play the classics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of late years M. Ysaye has made his mark as a conductor, and has
      given a series of orchestral concerts in Brussels. He organised
      and managed this enterprise entirely by himself, without any
      guarantee fund, and the concerts were so successful, financially
      as well as artistically, that at the end of the season it was
      found that they had paid all expenses, and this, as all who know
      anything about the financial side of or<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page276" id="page276"></a>{276}</span>
      chestral concerts, is a most remarkable showing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few, if any, artists have been made the recipients of more
      ridiculous adulation from women Paderewski perhaps being the only
      exception, and at the conclusion of his concerts scenes have been
      witnessed which are simply nauseating. This fashion is not
      confined, by any means, to the United States, for there are
      anecdotes from all countries illustrative of the manner in which
      members of the fair sex vie with each other in the effort to do
      the silliest things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ysaye has a home near the Palais de Justice in Brussels. He is
      married to the daughter of a Belgian army officer, and has
      several children. He is a man of much modesty, and is devoted to
      his family. As a violinist he may be considered to rank next to
      Joachim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl Halir, who visited America in 1896, was born in 1859 at
      Hohenelbe in Bohemia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id=
      "page277"></a>{277}</span> and was first taught by his father. He
      entered the conservatory at Prague at the age of eight, and
      remained there until he was fourteen, studying under Bennewitz,
      after which he went to Berlin and became a pupil of Joachim.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time he was a member of the Bilse orchestra, and then
      went to Königsberg as concert-master, after which he held a
      similar position for three years at Mannheim, and then at Weimar,
      where he married the well-known singer, Theresa Zerbst.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his first appearance, at the Bach festival at Eisenath, he
      played with Joachim the Bach double concerto, and was very
      successful. He has made concert tours throughout the greater part
      of Europe, and while in America he was recognised as a broad
      artist. He is no virtuoso in the ordinary sense of the word, but
      a classical, non-sensational, well-educated musician, whose
      playing was not dazzling or magnetic, but delighted by
      its<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id=
      "page278"></a>{278}</span> intellectuality. He has an even and
      sympathetic tone, and inspires the greatest respect as an artist
      and as a man, and, while other players may make greater popular
      successes, Halir stands on a high artistic plane which few can
      reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Franz Ondricek, who visited the United States also in 1896, was
      born at Prague in 1859, the same year as Halir, but is an artist
      of an entirely different stamp. In his early youth he was a
      member of a dance music band, and his father taught him to play
      the violin. It was not until he was fourteen years of age that he
      was able to enter the conservatory of his native town. Three
      years later he was sent, through the generosity of a wealthy
      merchant, to Paris, where he became a pupil of Massart. He shared
      with Achille Rivarde the honour of the first prize at the
      Conservatoire, since which time he has been a wandering star, and
      has never sought any permanent engage<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>{279}</span> ment.
      His playing is marked by individuality and dash, but he does not
      show to the best advantage in the interpretation of the classics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Martin Loeffler, who shares the first desk of the first
      violins in the Boston Symphony Orchestra with Mr. Kneisel, is a
      musician of the highest ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in Muhlhausen, Alsace, in 1861. He enjoyed the
      advantages of instruction under Joachim, in Berlin, after which
      he continued his studies in Paris, with Massart and Leonard,
      studying composition with Guiraud. While in Paris he was a member
      of Pasdeloup's celebrated orchestra, and was afterward appointed
      first violin and soloist in the private orchestra of Baron
      Derwies, at Nice, of which orchestra César Thomson was also a
      member.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1880 Mr. Loeffler crossed the Atlantic, and took up his
      residence in New York, but the following year he was engaged as
      second concert-master and soloist in the Boston<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>{280}</span>
      Symphony Orchestra, a position which he has held ever since, and
      in which he has had opportunity to display his exceptional
      talents.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a violinist he plays with largeness of style, boldness of
      contrast, and exquisite grace. He has a technique equalled by
      few, and his performances have been confined to music of the
      highest class. Mr. Loeffler has never made a tour of the country
      as a virtuoso, but as soloist of the orchestra he has been heard
      under the best conditions in most of the large cities of the
      United States, and has shown himself to be a virtuoso in the best
      sense of the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a composer Mr. Loeffler is distinctly original and
      imaginative. His works are both poetical and musical, and they
      display high thought and exceptional knowledge. His compositions
      include a sextet, a quintet, and an octet, also a suite for
      violin and orchestra, "Les Veillées de l'Ukraine;" a<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>{281}</span>
      concerto for violoncello, which has been played by Mr. Alwyn
      Schroeder; a divertimento for violin and orchestra, and a
      symphonic poem, "La Mort de Tintagiles." Besides these large
      works he has written a number of songs, of which five are with
      viola obligato. These works have been performed by the Kneisel
      Quartet and the Symphony Orchestra, the solo parts of the suite
      and divertimento by the composer himself, and they have gained
      for him a reputation as a gifted and scholarly tone artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most promising young violinists of the century was a
      native of Brazil, Maurice Dengremont, who was born in Rio
      Janeiro, in 1867. He was the son of a French musician who had
      settled in Brazil, and who gave him his first lessons to such
      good effect that, when only eight years of age, he gave a
      concert, and the Brazilian orchestra was so delighted with his
      playing that its members presented him with a medal,<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>{282}</span> to
      which the emperor added an imperial crown, as a recognition of
      his talent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now became a pupil of Leonard, and after three years' study he
      appeared in many concerts, travelling throughout Europe and
      England, and being received with enthusiasm. About 1880 he
      visited America, but his career ended shortly after, as he fell a
      victim to dissipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dengremont was compared with Sarasate and Wilhelmj, but all that
      could be said about him was that he might have developed into a
      player of their rank. As it was, he disappointed his admirers,
      and died while still quite young.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the many violinists who have made their home in the United
      States there are few whose accomplishments better entitle them to
      a position among celebrated violinists than Mr. Franz Kneisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kneisel was called to Boston to fill the position of
      concert-master of the Boston<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page283" id="page283"></a>{283}</span> Symphony Orchestra in
      1885, and has held that place for fourteen years, during which
      time he has done much toward the cultivation of musical taste in
      America.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in Roumania, of German parents, in 1865, and gained
      his musical education at Bucharest and at Vienna, where he
      studied under Grün and Hellmesberger. He then received the
      appointment of concert-master of the Hofburg Theatre Orchestra,
      after which he went to Berlin to fill the same position in
      Bilse's orchestra, following Halir, Ysaye, and César Thomson.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was called to Boston, at the instance of Mr. Gericke, who
      was then the conductor of the Symphony Orchestra, he was only
      twenty years of age. He played, on his first appearance as
      soloist, the Beethoven concerto, and was at once recognised as a
      violinist of remarkable ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Kneisel has never toured the country as a virtuoso, but has
      been heard in many of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id=
      "page284"></a>{284}</span> the great cities of America, as solo
      violinist with the Symphony Orchestra, and as first violin of the
      Kneisel Quartet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is a master of technique, and surmounts all difficulties with
      ease; his tone is pure, and, though not large, is satisfying, and
      in his interpretation of the great works he never attempts to
      enforce his personality upon the hearer,&mdash;in short, he is a
      true artist. As a conductor he has marked ability, and as a
      quartet player he has made a reputation which will live in the
      history of music in America, if not in the whole world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Gregorowitsch, who visited America in 1898, has risen in
      a very short time to a place among the leading violinists of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in 1867 at St. Petersburg, and, his talent making
      itself manifest in the usual manner, he was taught by his father
      until he was of an age to be sent to Moscow, where he studied
      until his fifteenth year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"
      id="page285"></a>{285}</span> under Besekirskij and Wieniawski.
      From Moscow he was sent to Vienna, where he became a pupil of
      Dont, and finally he studied under Joachim in Berlin, where he
      gained the Mendelssohn prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregorowitsch was the last pupil of Wieniawski, and that master
      was so impressed with the great promise of the boy that on first
      hearing him he offered to take him as a pupil gratis. Few
      violinists have had the advantage which has fallen to the lot of
      Gregorowitsch, of receiving instruction from so many great
      teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gregorowitsch has travelled extensively throughout Europe, has
      been highly honoured in Russia, where the Czar granted him
      exemption from military service, and decorated by the King of
      Portugal. In London he made his first appearance in 1897, at the
      Queen's Hall Symphony concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Gregorowitsch is remarkable for a large tone, and in the
      smoothness and finish of his<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page286" id="page286"></a>{286}</span> playing he has been
      compared with Sauret and with Sarasate.
    </p>
    <p>
      A far greater sensation was caused in America by Willie Burmester
      than by Gregorowitsch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burmester was born in Hamburg in 1869, and received his first
      instruction from his father. He owned his first violin when he
      was four years of age, and it came to him from a Christmas tree.
      This served to show the talent which he possessed, and the next
      year he received a better violin, and began to study in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was eight years old his father took him to Berlin to
      consult Joachim, who was, and is, regarded as the oracle for
      violinists. Joachim gave some encouragement to the parent,
      although he does not seem to have given much to the boy, who in
      consequence felt somewhat bitter. Four years later he was again
      taken to the Berlin Hochschule, to pass his entrance
      examination.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id=
      "page287"></a>{287}</span> On this occasion he received the
      recognition of the jury, and was admitted to the school, where he
      began a rigorous course of technical study. At the end of four
      years' study under Joachim he was refused a certificate, for some
      reason not stated, and he went to Helsingfors in Finland, where
      he worked according to his own ideas, which were to unlearn all
      he had studied, and begin afresh. During this period he worked
      with the greatest perseverance, practising nine or ten hours a
      day, and thus developed the wonderful technique which has
      astonished the world. For three years he continued this work,
      supporting himself meanwhile with a modest appointment which he
      had obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he left Berlin he had worn down the end of his first
      finger to the nerve. This troubled him to such a degree that he
      had several operations for the purpose of removing it, but the
      result was not wholly satisfactory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emerging from his retirement in 1894, he<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>{288}</span> went to
      Berlin again, and gave a recital in which he met with the most
      remarkable success. It was written at the time: "Mr. Burmester
      comes from an obscure town, unheralded, and, in the face of
      indifference, prejudice, and jealousy, conquered the metropolis
      off-hand. For nearly half an hour recall followed recall."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following season he created an equal impression in London,
      and shortly afterward in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      His technique has been described as "marvellous, almost
      diabolical." Difficult pizzicato passages and runs in thirds and
      tenths at top speed are but as child's play to him. His left hand
      pizzicato is marvellous, and he makes runs in single and
      artificial harmonics as quickly as most violinists can play an
      ordinary scale. He plays harmonics with a vibrato (Paganini
      played a double shake in harmonics), and his staccato volante is
      developed to an astounding degree of perfection.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page289" id="page289"></a>{289}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      When Burmester played in London his success was at once
      attributed to Joachim, and he resented it, in view of the fact
      that he had been denied his certificate and had narrowly escaped
      musical suffocation at the hands of that great master. He had
      already made the same statement in Berlin, referring to the fact
      of his retirement to Helsingfors, and the development which he
      had acquired there in solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      This announcement brought forth a deluge of letters from "pupils
      of Joachim," and in a couple of weeks Burmester wrote another
      letter stating that he did not know the Hochschule had as many
      pupils as those who had claimed Joachim as their teacher, and who
      were all unknown. "If one known pupil of Joachim," he wrote,
      "will appoint a meeting to interview me on the subject, I shall
      be glad to continue it." But the one known pupil did not come.
    </p>
    <p>
      The complaint of Mr. Burmester, that the<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>{290}</span> one
      idea at the Hochschule is technique, is not new by any means. In
      every school there are students with great talent, who find it
      difficult to subject themselves to the rigid discipline required
      by the teacher. It is the stumbling-block on which many fall. It
      is, nevertheless, a fact that without a solid technique the
      highest perfection in playing cannot be reached, and it is
      usually regarded as a hopeless case when the pupil antagonises
      the teacher. Many pupils are apt to try and run ahead of their
      technical ability, and do not find out their mistake until it is
      too late. The argument that Paganini was self-taught leads many a
      young violinist into error.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Burmester is to be judged by his playing of the Beethoven
      concerto in Boston, good musicians will declare that Joachim was
      right in refusing the certificate, for while his technique was
      brilliant it appeared to lack foundation. Time may justify the
      stand which the young virtuoso has taken in
      opposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id=
      "page291"></a>{291}</span> to his teacher, for he is still young
      and has time in which to develop. He has undoubted musical talent
      and great ability, but while he may be a celebrated violinist he
      can hardly yet be considered a great one, notwithstanding the
      furore which he caused in Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burmester plays with unassuming simplicity and without cheap
      display. He is sincere, but without authority or distinction of
      style. His tone is warm and pleasing, but not large, his
      intonation is not always sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Burmester's earliest musical friends was Hans Von Bülow,
      and the friendship extended over a period of three and a half
      years, until Von Bülow went to Cairo shortly before his death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Von Bülow had inaugurated a series of orchestral concerts in
      Berlin, and as they interfered with the Philharmonic series every
      effort was made to put a stop to them. Musicians were forbidden
      to play for Von<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id=
      "page292"></a>{292}</span> Büllow, and many obstacles were placed
      in his way. Von Büllow's temperament was such as to intensify the
      hostility rather than succumb to it. Burmester was then only
      sixteen years old, but his sympathy was with Von Büllow, and he
      wrote a letter to him offering his services, and expressing his
      contempt for the injustice to which he was being subjected. Von
      Büllow invited him to attend the rehearsals, and printed the
      letter which he had received. Burmester accepted the invitation,
      and, going to the rehearsal, found vacant a seat amongst the
      first violins, which he took.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rehearsal was about to commence when Von Büllow paused and
      asked, "Which of you gentlemen is Burmester?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow approached Von Büllow, who had motioned him to
      come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Burmester," he said, "I have no desk in the first row to
      offer you or it would be yours. Gentlemen," he added, turning
      to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id=
      "page293"></a>{293}</span> the musicians, "I wish to introduce to
      you the guest of honour of my orchestra, Mr. Burmester."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the beginning of a friendship, through which the young
      violinist showed unswerving loyalty, and it is now one of his
      greatest desires to reach a point of independence which will
      enable him to build a monument to Von Bülow's memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1893 a sensation was created in America by the visit of Henri
      Marteau, a young French violinist whose excellent playing and
      charming personality delighted all who heard him. Marteau was
      called "the Paderewski of the Catgut," and he met with a most
      cordial reception among musicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marteau was born at Reims in 1874. His father was an amateur
      violinist and president of the Philharmonic Society of Reims. His
      mother was an accomplished pianist, a pupil of Madame Schumann.
      He therefore had<span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id=
      "page294"></a>{294}</span> every advantage in his early youth for
      the development of musical taste. When he was about five years of
      age Sivori paid a visit to the family, and was so charmed with
      the little fellow that he gave him a violin, and persuaded his
      parents to let him become a professional violinist. Marteau now
      began to take lessons of Bunzl, a pupil of Molique, but three
      years later he went to Paris, and was placed under Leonard. In
      1884, when ten years of age, he played in public before an
      audience of 2,500 people, and in the following year he was
      selected by Gounod to play the obligato of a piece composed for
      the Joan of Arc Centenary celebration at Reims, which piece was
      dedicated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1892 Marteau carried off the first prize for violin playing at
      the Paris Conservatoire, and Massenet, the celebrated French
      composer, wrote a concerto for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Marteau played in Boston at the Symphony concerts he
      received twelve re<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id=
      "page295"></a>{306}</span> calls, and immediately became the idol
      of the hour. The concerto selected was that in G minor by Bruch,
      and it was played without a rehearsal, a fact which reflects
      great credit on the orchestra, which was at that time conducted
      by Mr. Arthur Nikisch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following year Marteau again visited America and brought
      with him a concerto composed for him by Dubois. This was played
      for the first time by the Colonne orchestra, with Marteau as
      soloist, at Paris, on November 28, 1894, and again on the
      following Sunday. It was next given at Marseilles on December
      12th, and the next performances were at Pittsburg, Louisville,
      and Nashville during the second American tour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marteau's tone is large, brilliant, and penetrating. His
      technique is sure, and he plays with contagious warmth of
      sentiment and great artistic charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The violin which he used during his<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page296" id="page296"></a>{296}</span> American tours was a
      Maggini, which once belonged to Maria Theresa of Austria. She
      gave it to a Belgian musician who had played chamber music with
      her in Vienna. He took it to Belgium, where at his death it
      became the property of Leonard, who, at his death, gave it to
      Marteau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alexander Petschnikoff, the son of a Russian soldier, is the
      latest violinist who has created a furore in Europe. When he was
      quite young his parents moved to Moscow, near which city he was
      born, and one day a musician of the Royal Opera House happened to
      hear the boy, who had already endeavoured to master the
      difficulties of the instrument, and he used his influence to get
      the lad into the conservatory. Petschnikoff now became a pupil of
      Hrimaly, and devoted himself to hard work, earning some money by
      teaching even at the age of ten.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course he won the first prize and the gold medal at the
      conservatory, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id=
      "page297"></a>{297}</span> then offered an opportunity to study
      in Paris, which he declined. For a time he earned his living by
      playing in a theatre orchestra, but fortune smiled upon him, and
      he became an object of interest to the Princess Ourosoff, who
      heard him play at a concert. Her influence was exerted in his
      behalf, and he was soon noticed and courted by the nobility. The
      princess also made him a present of a magnificent violin, which
      formerly belonged to Ferdinand Laub, and is said to be the most
      costly instrument in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he made his début in Berlin, in 1895, his success was
      unprecedented, inasmuch as it covered four points,&mdash;the
      artistic, popular, social, and financial. He has created a furore
      wherever he has appeared, and has been recalled as many as
      sixteen times. So great has been his success that he is said to
      have received the highest honorarium for a single concert ever
      obtained by a violinist in Europe.<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page298" id="page298"></a>{298}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      He is described as a man of commonplace appearance, with dull,
      expressionless eyes, sluggish movements, and slow, affected
      manner of speech. His technique is not astonishing, but he has a
      full, penetrating, sympathetic tone. There is no charlatanism or
      trickery in his playing, nor any virtuoso effects, but the charm
      of it rests in his glowing temperament, ideal conception, and
      wonderful power of expression. He has been regarded as
      phenomenal, because he can move the hearts of his hearers as few
      other violinists are able to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Petschnikoff has been given an introduction to America, through
      Mr. Emil Paur, by Theodor Leschetizky, couched in the most
      glowing terms, and is called by him "an artist of the very first
      rank and of inconceivable versatility."
    </p>
    <p>
      One might prolong the list of violinists to a tremendous extent,
      and yet fail to mention all those of great merit. In England,
      John<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id=
      "page299"></a>{299}</span> Dunn appears to be acquiring a great
      reputation. On the Continent, such names as Hubay, Petri, Rosé
      are well known. In America, we have Leopold Lichtenberg, a good
      musician of admirable qualifications. Bernhard Listemann, now of
      Chicago, has done much toward forming musical taste in America,
      and was concert-master of the Boston Symphony Orchestra during
      the first few years of its existence. But space does not permit
      of a mention of more than has been attempted, and a few pages
      must be given to lady violinists and to a few words about
      celebrated quartets.

      WOMEN AS VIOLINISTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the past forty or fifty years the violin has become a
      fashionable instrument for ladies, and has become correspondingly
      popular as a profession for those who are obliged to earn a
      living.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formerly, for many years, it seems to have been considered
      improper, or ungraceful, or unladylike,&mdash;the reasons are
      nowhere satisfactorily given, but the fact remains that until
      recently few women played the violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the year 1610 until 1810 the list of those who played in
      public is extremely short, numbering only about twenty, and of
      these several were gambists.
    </p>
    <p>
      That women did, once upon a time, play<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>{301}</span> on the
      violin, or the corresponding string and bow instruments which
      were its ancestors, there is evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the painted roof of Peterborough Cathedral, in England, which
      is said to have been built in the year 1194 A.D., there is a
      picture of a woman seated, and holding in her lap a sort of viol,
      with four strings and four sound-holes. This seems to indicate
      that in very early days ladies sometimes played on stringed
      instruments, if only for their own amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the accounts of King Henry VII., dated November 2, 1495, is
      the following item, "For a womane that singeth with a fiddle, 2
      shillings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne of Cleves after her divorce comforted herself by playing on
      a viol with six strings. Queen Elizabeth, also, amused herself
      not only with the lute, the virginals, and her voice, but also
      with the violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      These, however, were amateurs, and the<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>{302}</span>
      earliest professional violinist known was Mrs. Sarah Ottey, who
      was born about 1695, and who about 1721-22 performed frequently
      at concerts, giving solos on the harpsichord, violin, and bass
      viol. Previous to her there was one Signora Leonora Baroni, born
      at Mantua about 1610, but she played the theorbo and the viol di
      gamba.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next is "La Diamantina," born about 1715, who is referred to
      by the poet Gray in 1740, when he was at Rome, as "a famous
      virtuosa, played on the violin divinely, and sung angelically."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anne Nicholl, born in England about 1728, played the violin
      before the Duke of Cumberland at Huntley in 1746, and her
      granddaughter, Mary Anne Paton, also, who was better known as a
      singer and who became Lady Lenox, and afterwards Mrs. Wood, was a
      violinist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The celebrated Madame Gertrude Elizabeth Mara, one of the
      greatest singers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id=
      "page303"></a>{303}</span> her time, was a violinist when young.
      Her father took her to England, hoping by means of her playing to
      get sufficient money to give her a thorough musical education.
      She was then a mere child, and as she grew to womanhood her voice
      developed and she became one of the celebrities in the history of
      song. There is no doubt that the training in intervals which her
      practice on the violin gave her proved invaluable as an aid to
      her in singing. In later days several of the most celebrated
      singers have been also good violinists, as, for instance,
      Christine Nilsson and Marcella Sembrich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maddalena Lombardi Sirmen, born about 1735, had an almost
      European reputation toward the end of the eighteenth century. She
      visited France and England about 1760-61, and was so good a
      player that she was looked upon almost as a rival of Nardini. She
      will always be celebrated in history because of the letter which
      was written to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id=
      "page304"></a>{304}</span> her by Tartini, and which is not only
      one of the rarities of musical literature, but constitutes also a
      valuable treatise on the use of the violin.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter, which has been printed in almost every book on the
      violin, would take up rather more space than can be afforded in
      this sketch. It is admirably clear and is divided into three
      parts, the first giving advice on bowing, "pressing the bow
      lightly but steadily, upon the strings in such a manner as that
      it shall seem to <i>breathe</i> the first tone it gives, which
      must proceed from the friction of the string, and not from
      percussion, as by a blow given with a hammer upon it,&mdash;if
      the tone is <i>begun</i> with delicacy, there is little danger of
      rendering it afterwards either coarse or harsh." The second
      section of the letter is devoted to the finger-board, or the
      "carriage of the left hand," and the last part to the "shake."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maddalena Sirmen received her instruc<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>{305}</span> tion
      first at the conservatory of Mendicanti at Venice, after which
      she took lessons from Tartini. She also composed a considerable
      quantity of violin music, much of which was published at
      Amsterdam. About 1782 she, emulating the example of Madame Mara,
      appeared as a singer at Dresden, but with comparatively small
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regina Sacchi, who married a noted German violoncellist named
      Schlick, was celebrated for her performances on the violin. She
      was born at Mantua in 1764, and educated at the Conservatorio
      della Pietà at Venice. This lady was highly esteemed by Mozart,
      who said of her, "No human being can play with more feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mozart was in Vienna, about 1786, Madame Schlick was also
      there, and solicited him to write something for the piano and
      violin, which they should play together at a concert. Mozart
      willingly promised to do so, and accordingly composed and
      arranged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id=
      "page306"></a>{306}</span> <i>in his mind</i>, his beautiful
      sonata in B-flat minor, for piano and violin. The time for the
      concert drew near, but not a note was put upon paper, and Madame
      Schlick's anxiety became painful. Eventually, after much
      entreaty, she received the manuscript of the violin part the
      evening before the concert, and set herself to work to study it,
      taking scarcely any rest that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sonata was played before an audience consisting of the rank
      and fashion of Vienna. The execution of the two artists was
      perfect and the applause was enthusiastic. It happened, however,
      that the Emperor Joseph II., who was seated in a box just above
      the performers, in using his opera-glass to look at Mozart,
      noticed that there was nothing on his desk but a sheet of blank
      paper, and, afterward calling the composer to him, said: "So,
      Mozart, you have once again trusted to chance," to which Mozart,
      of course, graciously acquiesced, though the emperor
      did<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id=
      "page307"></a>{307}</span> not state whether he considered
      Mozart's knowledge of his new composition, or Madame Schlick's
      ability to play with him unrehearsed, constituted the "chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next virtuosa was a Frenchwoman, Louise Gautherot, who was
      born about 1760, and who played in London and made a great
      impression about 1780 to 1790, and about the same time Signora
      Vittoria dall' Occa played at the theatre in Milan. Signora
      Paravicini, born about 1769, and Luigia Gerbini, about 1770, were
      pupils of Viotti, and earned fame. The former made a sensation in
      1799 by her performance of some violin concertos at the Italian
      Theatre at Lisbon, where she played between the acts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Signora Paravicini attracted the attention of the Empress
      Josephine, who became her patroness and engaged her to teach her
      son, Eugene Beauharnais, and took her to Paris. After a time,
      however, the Empress neglected her, and she suffered from
      poverty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id=
      "page308"></a>{308}</span> Driven to the last resource, and
      having even pawned her clothes, she applied for aid to the
      Italians resident in Paris, and they enabled her to return to
      Milan, where her ability soon gained her both competence and
      credit. She also played at Vienna in 1827, and at Bologna in
      1832, where she was much admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Catarina Calcagno, who has already been mentioned as a pupil of
      Paganini, was a native of Genoa, born about 1797, and had a short
      but brilliant career. She disappeared from before the public in
      1816.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Krahmer and Mlles. Eleanora Neumann, and M. Schulz all
      delighted the public in Vienna and Prague. Miss Neumann came from
      Moscow, and astonished the public when she had scarcely reached
      her tenth year. Other names are Madame Filipowicz, Madame
      Pollini, Mlle. Zerchoff, Eliza Wallace, and Rosina Collins, who
      all played publicly and were well known.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>{309}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1827 Teresa Milanollo was born, and in 1832 her sister Marie,
      and these two young ladies played so well, and were in such
      striking contrast to one another, that they proved very
      successful as concert players. They were natives of Savigliano,
      in Piedmont, where their father was a manufacturer of
      silk-spinning machinery. Teresa, the elder, was taught by
      Ferrero, Caldera, and Morra, but in 1836 she went to Paris and
      studied under Lafont, and afterwards under Habeneck, going still
      later to Brussels, where she took lessons of De Bériot, and
      received the finishing touch to her artistic
      education,&mdash;faultless intonation. Her career as a concert
      player began when she was about nine years of age. When Marie was
      old enough to handle a violin Teresa began to teach her, and in
      fact was the only teacher Marie ever had.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters, who were called, on account of their most
      striking characteristics,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"
      id="page310"></a>{310}</span> Mlle. Staccato and Mlle. Adagio,
      travelled together through France, Holland, Belgium, Germany, and
      England, and were everywhere received with the greatest interest.
      They played before Louis Philippe at Neuilly, and appeared with
      Liszt before the King of Prussia. They also created a furore at
      Vienna and Berlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie, the younger, who was of a happy and cheerful disposition,
      was not strong, and in 1848 she died in Paris. Teresa, the elder,
      after a long retirement, resumed her travels, and, having matured
      and improved, she played better and excited more interest than
      before. In 1857 she married a French officer, Captain Théodore
      Parmentier, who had seen service in the Crimean War, and she
      abandoned the concert stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1857 until 1878 she followed the fortunes of her husband,
      who became a general and a "Grand Officier de la
      Legion<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311" id=
      "page311"></a>{311}</span> d'Honneur," and her public appearances
      were limited to such places as the vicissitudes of a military
      life took her to. Since 1878 Madame Parmentier has lived quietly
      in Paris, where she is still to be met by a few fortunate persons
      in select musical and social circles.

    <p>
      During the lifetime of Marie, the sisters had already put
      themselves into direct personal relations with the poor of Lyons,
      but after Teresa had roused herself from her mourning for her
      sister she established a system of "Concerts aux Pauvres," which
      she carried out in nearly all the chief cities of France, and
      part of the receipts of these concerts was used for the benefit
      of the poor. Her plan was to follow up the first concert with a
      second, at which the audience consisted of poor school-children
      and their parents, to whom she played in her most fascinating
      manner, and, at the conclusion of her performance, money, food,
      and cloth<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id=
      "page312"></a>{312}</span> ing, purchased with the receipts of
      the previous concerts, were distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1830 there has been a constantly increasing number of ladies
      who have appeared as concert violinists, but few have continued
      long before the public, or have reached such a point of
      excellence as to be numbered amongst the great performers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mlle. Emilia Arditi, Fraülein Hortensia Zirges, Miss Hildegard
      Werner, Miss Bertha Brousil, and Madame Rosetta Piercy-Feeny were
      all born during the decade 1830 to 1840, and were well known, but
      in 1840 and 1842 two violinists were born who were destined to
      hold the stage for many years and to exert a great influence in
      their profession. Wilma Neruda, now known as Lady Hallé and
      Camilla Urso are the two ladies in question, the former exerting
      her influence chiefly in England and on the Continent, and the
      latter in America.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id=
      "page313"></a>{313}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Werner has played an important part in advancing the art
      amongst women, having for many years conducted a school of music
      at Newcastle-on-Tyne, in England. She was also the first woman
      ever to address the Literary and Philosophical Society, when in
      1880 she delivered an address on the history of the violin. There
      is little doubt, however, that the success of Teresa Milanollo
      gave the first great impulse toward the study of the violin by
      women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Hallé was born at Brünn, March 21, 1840. Her father was
      Josef Neruda, a musician of good ability, and he gave her the
      first instruction on the violin, and then placed her under
      Leopold Jansa, in Vienna. Wilhelmina Maria Franziska Neruda made
      her first appearance in public in 1846, at which time she was not
      quite seven years old. On this occasion her sister Amalie, who
      was a pianist, accompanied her, and shortly afterwards her father
      took her, with her sister Amalie and<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>{314}</span> one of
      her brothers, on an extended tour. The family consisted of two
      sons&mdash;a pianist and a 'cellist&mdash;and two
      daughters&mdash;a violinist and a pianist.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1849 they reached London, where the young violinist played a
      concerto by De Bériot, at the seventh Philharmonic concert of
      that season. By the critics at that time she was said to be
      wonderful in bravura music, in musical intelligence, and in her
      remarkable accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time went on, and her playing matured, she became known
      throughout Europe. In 1864 she married Ludwig Norman, conductor
      of the opera at Stockholm, and for a time she remained in that
      city and became a teacher at the Royal Music School.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before long she was again busy with concert playing, and in 1869
      she again appeared in England, where she became a great
      favourite, and has appeared there regularly almost, if not quite,
      every season since. Hans von<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page315" id="page315"></a>{315}</span> Bülow spoke of her as
      Joachim's rival, and called her "the violin fairy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim has always been a great favourite in England, but Madame
      Norman-Neruda, or Lady Hallé, as she became later, has fully
      shared his popularity. What Joachim is to the sterner sex, just
      the same is Lady Hallé to the gentler.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joachim was indeed one of the first to recognise the fact that he
      had in Mlle. Neruda a rival, for in the days when she was earning
      her reputation he heard her at some place on the Continent, and
      remarked to Charles Hallé, who afterwards became her husband, "I
      recommend this artist to your careful consideration. Mark this,
      when people have given her a fair hearing, they will think more
      of her and less of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ludwig Norman died in 1885, and three years later Madame
      Norman-Neruda married the pianist, Charles Hallé, who had long
      been identified with all that was best musically in<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>{316}</span>
      England, and who was knighted in recognition of his services to
      the cause of art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Hallé established a series of orchestral concerts at
      Manchester in 1857, and by means of these concerts brought before
      the English public the works of many composers who would have
      remained unknown perhaps for years but for his efforts. In this
      work he was ably supported by this talented violinist, afterwards
      his wife, and with her he made many tours all over the British
      Isles.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1890 Sir Charles and Lady Hallé made a tour in Australia,
      which was highly successful. Five years later they went to South
      Africa, where they met with a flattering reception. In his
      memoirs, Sir Charles Hallé tells of a curious compliment which
      they received at Pietermaritzburg. The mayor invited them to play
      at a municipal concert to be given one Sunday afternoon. The
      concert began, and after an organ solo<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>{317}</span> and a
      song had been given by other musicians, they played the Kreutzer
      sonata. At the conclusion of the sonata, a member of the
      corporation came forward, and said that after the impression just
      received he thought it would be best to omit the remainder of the
      programme, upon which the audience cheered and dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1895, shortly after their return from the South African tour,
      Sir Charles Hallé died, and Lady Hallé went into retirement. At
      this time her numerous admirers in England presented her with a
      valuable testimonial of their appreciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout her career she has fulfilled the prophecies made of
      her in her youth, for her talent and musicianship developed as
      she grew up, and her genius did not burn itself out as that of
      many infant prodigies has done. She has never endeavoured to
      secure public applause at the expense of her real artistic
      nature. Her performances are and<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page318" id="page318"></a>{318}</span> always have been
      synonymous with all that is good in musical art, and nothing but
      that which is of the best has ever been allowed to appear upon
      her programmes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She is celebrated no less as a quartet player than as a soloist,
      and was for many years first violin of the Philharmonic Quartet
      in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1898, Lady Hallé had the misfortune to lose her son, Mr.
      Norman Neruda, who, while scaling a difficult place in the Alps,
      slipped and was killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following year she emerged from her retirement and visited
      the United States, where her playing was highly appreciated by
      unbiassed critics. There was a feeling, however, that she might
      have made the journey many years before, and allowed the American
      public to hear her in her prime, when she would have received not
      only a very warm welcome, but would have been judged rather by
      her merits than by her history, and she<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>{319}</span> would
      not have challenged comparison with the violinists of the rising
      generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camilla Urso has been for many years one of the best known
      violinists in the United States. She was born at Nantes, in
      France, in 1842, of Italian parents. Her father was Salvator
      Urso, a good musician, and son of a good musician, so that the
      young violinist inherited some of her talent. In 1852 the family
      crossed the Atlantic and settled in the United States, and almost
      immediately the little girl began to appear at concerts. Camilla
      Urso began to study the violin at the age of six years, and her
      choice of that instrument was determined by her hearing the
      violin and being fascinated by it during a celebration of the
      Mass of St. Cecilia. She was taken to Paris for instruction, for
      which purpose her father abandoned his position at Nantes. She
      entered the Conservatoire and became a pupil of Massart.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a tour through Germany, during<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>{320}</span> which
      she met with immense success, and then returned to Paris to
      continue her studies.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was fresh from Massart's instruction when, in October, 1852,
      she made her first appearance in Boston, where her playing and
      her style called forth eulogies from the critics of those days.
      John S. Dwight wrote to the effect that it was one of the most
      touching experiences of his life to see and hear the charming
      little maiden, so natural and childlike, so full of sentiment and
      thought, so self-possessed and graceful. Her tone was pure, and
      her intonation faultless, and she played with a "fine and
      caressing delicacy," and gave out strong passages in chords with
      thrilling grandeur.
    </p>
    <p>
      For three years she continued to travel and delight American
      audiences, and then for a period of about five years she retired
      into private life, and did not resume her professional career
      until 1862, from which time <span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page321" id="page321"></a>{321}</span> she frequently made
      concert tours in America until she returned to Paris. It was
      about the period of these tours that her influence upon young
      women began to be felt, for she was at an age when womanly grace
      becomes evident, and her manners and character were as
      fascinating as her playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Paris she so pleased M. Pasdeloup that he begged her not to
      allow herself to be heard in public until she had played at his
      concerts. "You may count upon a splendid triumph," he said. "It
      is <i>I</i> who tell you so. Your star is in the ascendant, and
      soon it will shine at the zenith of the artistic firmament."
    </p>
    <p>
      The result justified the prophecy, and Camilla Urso was the
      recipient of great honours in Paris. She was presented by the
      public with a pair of valuable diamond earrings, and was treated
      almost like a prima donna.
    </p>
    <p>
      In March, 1867, Mlle. Urso received a<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>{322}</span>
      testimonial from the musical profession in Boston, where a few
      years later she had a curious experience. She was playing a
      Mozart concerto, at a concert, when an alarm of fire was given,
      and caused a good deal of excitement. Many of the audience left
      their seats and made for the door, but the violinist stood
      unmoved until the alarm was subdued and the audience returned to
      their seats, when she played the interrupted movement through
      from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1879 she made a tour to Australia, and again in 1894.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1895 she was in South Africa, and achieved great triumphs in
      Cape Town, besides giving concerts at such out-of-the-way places
      as Bloemfontein. She has probably travelled farther than any
      other violin virtuosa.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past few years she has lived in New York, and has
      practically retired from the concert stage.<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>{323}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Teresina Tua, who was well known in the United States about 1887,
      was born at Turin in 1867. As in the case of Wilhelmina Neruda
      and of Camilla Urso, her father was a musician, and she received
      her early musical instruction from him. Her first appearance in
      public was made at the age of seven, and up to that time she had
      received no instruction, except that given her by her father.
      During her first tour she played at Nice, where a wealthy Russian
      lady, Madame Rosen, became interested in her, and provided the
      means to go to Paris, where she was placed under Massart.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1880 Signorina Tua won the first prize for violin playing at
      the Paris Conservatoire, and the following year made a concert
      tour which extended through France and Spain to Italy. In 1882
      she appeared in Vienna, and in 1883 in London, where she played
      at the Crystal Palace. Wherever she went people of wealth and
      distinction showed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id=
      "page324"></a>{324}</span> greatest interest in her, and when she
      came to America in 1887 she appeared laden with jewelry given her
      by royalty. Her list of jewels was given in the journals of that
      day,&mdash;"a miniature violin and bow ablaze with diamonds,
      given by the Prince and Princess of Wales; a double star with a
      solitaire pearl in the centre, and each point tipped with pearls,
      from Queen Margherita of Italy." Besides these, there were
      diamonds from the Queen of Spain and from the Empress of Russia
      and sundry grand duchesses. No lady violinist ever appeared
      before an American audience more gorgeously arrayed. "Fastened
      all over the bodice of her soft white woollen gown she wore these
      sparkling jewels, and in her hair were two or three diamond
      stars," said the account in Dwight's <i>Journal of Music</i>. Yet
      with all this the criticisms of her playing were somewhat
      lukewarm. The expectation of the people had been wrought up to an
      unreas<span class="pagenum"><a name="page325" id=
      "page325"></a>{325}</span> onable pitch, and Signorina Tua, while
      she was acknowledged to be an excellent and charming violinist,
      was not considered <i>great.</i> After a time, however, as she
      became better known, she grew in popular estimation, and before
      she left America she had hosts of admirers.
    </p>
    <p>
      On returning to Europe she made another tour, but shortly
      afterwards she married Count Franchi Verney della Valetta, a
      distinguished Italian critic, and retired into private life,
      though from time to time she was heard in concerts in Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1897 she was again on the concert stage, and played at St.
      James's Hall, London, after an absence of eight years, and it was
      considered that her playing had gained in breadth, while her
      technique was as perfect as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the three hundred or more pupils of Joachim, there have been
      several ladies who have attained celebrity, of whom Miss
      Emily<span class="pagenum"><a name="page326" id=
      "page326"></a>{326}</span> Shinner (now Mrs. A. F. Liddell) has
      been for some years the most prominent in England, while the
      names of Gabrielle Wietrowitz and Marie Soldat are known
      throughout Europe, and Maude Powell and Leonora Jackson are among
      the brightest lights from the United States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Emily Shinner has been in many respects a pioneer amongst
      lady violinists, for in 1874, when quite young, she went to
      Berlin to study the violin. In those days pupils of the fair sex
      were not admitted to the Hochschule, and Miss Shinner began to
      study under Herr Jacobsen. It happened, however, that a lady from
      Silesia arrived at Berlin, intending to take lessons of Joachim,
      but unaware of the rules against the admission of women to the
      Hochschule. Joachim interested himself in her, and she was
      examined for admission. Miss Shinner at once presented herself as
      a second candidate, and the result was that both ladies were
      accepted<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327" id=
      "page327"></a>{327}</span> as probationers. In six months Miss
      Shinner was allowed to become a pupil of Joachim, and thus gained
      the distinction of being the first girl violinist to study under
      the great professor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again in 1884 Miss Shinner, having acquired a great reputation in
      musical circles in England, was called upon at very short notice
      to take Madame Neruda's place as leader to the "Pop" Quartet, on
      which occasion she acquitted herself so well that an encore of
      the second movement of the quartet was demanded. Since that time
      she has been always before the public, and has taken special
      interest in chamber music and quartet playing, the Shinner
      Quartet of ladies having acquired a national reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her marriage to Capt. A. F. Liddell took place in 1889.
    </p>
    <p>
      Marie Soldat was born at Gratz in 1863 or 1864, and was the
      daughter of a musician, who was pianist, organist, and
      choirmaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page328" id=
      "page328"></a>{328}</span> and who gave her instruction from her
      fifth year on the piano. Two years later she began to learn the
      organ, and was soon able to act as substitute for her father when
      occasion required her services. Until her twelfth year she
      studied music vigorously, taking violin lessons with Pleiner at
      the Steier Musical Union at Gratz, and composition with Thierot,
      the Kapellmeister, at the same time keeping on with the
      pianoforte.
    </p>
    <p>
      She played the phantasie-caprice by Vieuxtemps in a concert at
      the Musical Union when she was ten years of age, and at thirteen
      she went on a tour and played Bruch's G minor concerto.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this she had the misfortune to lose her father, and a
      little later her violin teacher, Pleiner, also died, so that her
      progress received a check. Joachim, however, visited Gratz to
      play at a concert, and the young girl went to him and consulted
      him<span class="pagenum"><a name="page329" id=
      "page329"></a>{329}</span> as to her future course. As a result
      of the interview she began to take lessons of August Pott, a good
      violinist at Gratz, and the following year (1879) she again went
      on a concert tour, visiting several cities in Austria.
    </p>
    <p>
      During this tour, she made the acquaintance of Johannes Brahms,
      who took a great deal of interest in her, advised her to devote
      all her energies to the violin, and succeeded in arranging for
      another interview with Joachim, the result of which was that she
      was enabled to enter the Berlin High School for Music. Here she
      pursued her studies until 1882, after which she still continued
      her studies and took private lessons of Joachim.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the high school she gained the Mendelssohn prize, and from
      that time commenced her career as a virtuosa, touring extensively
      throughout Europe. One of her greatest triumphs was when, in
      1885,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page330" id=
      "page330"></a>{330}</span> at Vienna, she played Brahm's violin
      concerto with Richter's orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her career has been marked by hard work and continual practice,
      which have enabled her to overcome many obstacles, and have
      placed her on a level with the very best violinists of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Ladies' String Quartet, which she formed in Berlin,
      consisting of herself as first violin, with Agnes Tschetchulin,
      Gabrielle Roy, and Lucie Campbell, had a creditable career, and
      appeared in several German cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1889 Marie Soldat married a lawyer named Röger, but did not
      retire from her profession. She is now known as Madame
      Soldat-Röger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gabrielle Wietrowitz was born a few years later, in 1866, at
      Laibach, and was also a pupil at the Musical Institute at Gratz.
      Her father was a military bandsman who had some knowledge of the
      violin, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id=
      "page331"></a>{331}</span> enabled him to give his daughter
      elementary instruction on that instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few years he left Laibach to settle in Gratz, and
      Gabrielle took violin lessons from A. Geyer (some accounts say
      Caspar). On entering the Musical Union she made a sensation by
      playing brilliantly at a concert before a large audience. She was
      then eleven years of age, and from that time she made the most
      rapid progress, taking first prize at the annual trial concert.
      In consequence of her great promise Count Aichelburg, who was a
      member of the Directorate of the Musical Union, presented her
      with a valuable violin, and the Directorate assigned her a yearly
      salary which enabled her to go to Berlin and enter the high
      school, where she became a pupil of Joachim in 1882.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the high school her career was as brilliant as it had been in
      Gratz, for at the end of her first year she succeeded in
      capturing the Mendelssohn prize, which brought<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>{332}</span> her
      1,500 marks, and at the end of her third year she took it for a
      second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      She remained at the high school three years, after which she
      began a splendid career by playing the concerto by Brahms at the
      St. Cecilia Festival at Münster. Then followed a series of
      concert tours, which resulted in securing her a reputation as one
      of the most brilliant stars amongst women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Wietrowitz plays with the most consummate ease the greatest
      works of the modern school. She has a powerful and brilliant
      tone, with sweet tenderness and sympathy, which appeal to the
      soul of the listener, and she confines her repertoire to the
      highest class of musical compositions. She has recently succeeded
      Miss Emily Shinner as first violin in the quartet which that
      talented lady established in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent star of Europe is Madame Saenger-Sethe, whose
      appearances are invariably followed by eulogies from the
      critics.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333" id=
      "page333"></a>{333}</span> In Berlin, when she appeared at the
      Singakademie, in November, 1898, where she was assisted by the
      Philharmonic Orchestra, one critic declared that no violin
      playing had been heard to compare with it during that season,
      with the exception of Burmester's performance of the Beethoven
      concerto. "Such wealth and sensuous beauty of tone, such
      certainty of technique, such mental grasp of the work, and at the
      same time such all-conquering temperament have not been heard in
      Berlin at the hands of a female violinist during several years."
      After many recalls, she gave, as an encore, a rousing performance
      of a Bach sarabande.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mlle. Irma Sethe was born on April 28, 1876, at Brussels, and
      such was her early aptitude for music that at the age of five she
      was placed under a violinist of repute, named Jokisch, who in
      three months from the start taught her to play a Mozart sonata.
      Five years of hard study enabled her to<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page334" id="page334"></a>{334}</span> appear
      at a concert at Marchiennes, when she played a concerto by De
      Bériot and the rondo capriccioso by Saint-Saëns. The following
      year she played at Aix-la-Chapelle, and made such an impression
      that several offers of concert engagements were made, but were
      declined by her mother on the score of the child's health, and
      for three years after this she never appeared at a concert.
    </p>
    <p>
      One summer, during the holidays, she met August Wilhelmj, who was
      charmed with her talent, and devoted his mornings for two months
      to giving her lessons daily. At the end of that time he
      emphasised his appreciation by making her a present of a valuable
      violin. She still continued her regular studies with Jokisch,
      until, acting on the advice of her friends, she obtained a
      hearing from Ysaye, and played for him Bach's prelude and fugue
      in G minor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ysaye at once recognised her immense<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page335" id="page335"></a>{335}</span>
      ability, and advised her to enter the conservatoire at Brussels,
      which she did, with the result that in eight months she carried
      off the first prize, being then only fifteen years of age. She
      continued her studies for three more years, and was frequently
      employed as a substitute for Ysaye, as professor, to teach his
      classes while he was absent on concert tours.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1894 she appeared with him at a number of important concerts,
      and shortly afterwards made her first concert tour, visiting many
      of the principal towns of Germany. In November, 1895, she made
      her first appearance in London, where she was pronounced to be,
      with the exception of Lady Hallé, the most remarkable lady
      violinist who had ever appeared before the public in England, and
      where her excellent technique, perfect intonation, warmth of
      feeling, and musical insight were highly, almost extravagantly,
      praised.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id=
      "page336"></a>{336}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In August, 1898, Mlle. Sethe married Doctor Saenger, a
      <i>littérateur</i>, and professor of philosophy at Berlin, but
      she continues her career as a violinist, and has made several
      tours of Europe. She has been compared to Rubinstein, inasmuch as
      her remarkable musical temperament and irresistible impulsiveness
      carry her at times almost beyond the limits of her instrument,
      but these are the very qualities by which she captivates and
      carries away her hearers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other European ladies who have made their mark as
      violinists, and whose stars are in the ascendant, may be
      mentioned Sophie Jaffé, who has been called the greatest of all
      women violinists, and Frida Scotta.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although many years behind the continent of Europe in musical
      life, and with a musical atmosphere not nearly as dense as that
      found in almost any village of Italy, France, or Germany, America
      has contributed<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id=
      "page337"></a>{337}</span> to the musical world many shining
      lights during the past few years. Mlle. Urso has been claimed as
      an American violinist, though she was born in Europe and was a
      good violinist before she reached these shores, but in 1864, in
      New York, Anna Senkrah was born, who for a few years rivalled
      Teresina Tua.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real name of Arma Senkrah was Harkness, which for
      professional purposes she "turned end for end," as the sailors
      would say, and dropped an "s." After Miss Harkness had been
      taught the elements of music by her mother, she went to Brussels
      to study under Wieniawski, and then to Paris, where she became a
      pupil of Massart She is said also to have taken lessons of
      Vieuxtemps and of Arno Hilf.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1881 she won the first prize at the Paris Conservatoire, a
      feat which always stamps the winner "artist." From 1877 to 1880
      Arma Senkrah travelled a great deal<span class="pagenum"><a name=
      "page338" id="page338"></a>{338}</span> throughout Europe, and in
      1882 she played, under her proper name, at the Crystal Palace,
      London. She was created, at Weimar, a chamber virtuoso, by the
      grand duke. Here she met and shortly afterwards married a lawyer
      named Hoffman, and disappeared from the concert platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      New York has contributed other stars to the violin firmament, for
      Nettie Carpenter and Geraldine Morgan are names which have become
      well known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Carpenter went abroad at an early age, though not until she
      had appeared in concerts in her native city, and created
      considerable interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On going to Paris, she was successful in passing the entrance
      examinations for the Conservatoire, and in 1884 won the first
      prize for violin playing. In 1882 she appeared in London at the
      promenade concerts, and again in 1884, when she confirmed the
      reputation which she had made two years<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page339" id="page339"></a>{339}</span>
      previously, at the same concerts. From that time on she went
      through the usual routine of the concert violinist, with
      considerable success.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1894 she married Leo Stern, the violoncello player, but the
      union did not continue for long, Mr. Stern becoming about four
      years later the husband of Miss Suzanne Adams, the opera singer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Geraldine Morgan is the daughter of John P. Morgan, who was
      for some years organist of Old Trinity Church, New York. She
      studied in her native city under Leopold Damrosch, besides which
      she received much instruction from her father. Then she went to
      Leipzig, where she studied with Schradieck, after which she was
      the pupil in Berlin of Joachim, under whose guidance she remained
      eight years. She was the first American who ever gained the
      Mendelssohn prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Morgan has made tours through the<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>{340}</span>
      Continent and Great Britain, and had the honour of playing the
      Bach double concerto with Joachim at the Crystal Palace. In 1891
      she appeared in New York under the auspices of Walter Damrosch.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lady who holds a high position among the violinists of the
      world is Miss Maud Powell, who was born in Aurora, Ill., in 1868.
      Her father is American and her mother German. She began her
      musical education at the age of four, by taking piano lessons. At
      eight she took up the violin, and made such excellent progress
      that, when she was thirteen years old, she was taken to Leipzig,
      where she studied under Schradieck, and received her diploma in a
      year, playing also at one of the Gewandhaus concerts.
    </p>

        <b>MAUD POWELL</b>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      She next went to Paris, where she was the first selected out of
      eighty applicants for admission to the Conservatoire. In the
      following year she accepted an engagement for a tour in England,
      and had the honour <span class="pagenum"><a name="page341" id=
      "page341"></a>{341}</span> of playing before the royal family.
      While in London Joachim heard her, and expressed his approval of
      her capabilities by inviting her to go to Berlin and become one
      of his pupils, which she accordingly did, and remained with him
      for two years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1885 she made her début in Berlin at the Philharmonic
      concerts, when she played the Bruch concerto, which she also
      played in Philadelphia later in the same year. Her performance in
      America brought her much praise, and she was declared to be a
      marvellously gifted woman, one who in every feature of her
      playing disclosed the instincts and gifts of a born artist,
      though she had not yet reached the heights of her ability. Since
      that time she has gained in breadth, and has become a mature
      artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Powell has appeared in the best concerts throughout America,
      and has gained a reputation second to no American violinist. By
      many she is declared to be the equal of<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page342" id="page342"></a>{342}</span> Soldat
      and Wietrowitz in tone, technique, and interpretative power. She
      has an immense repertoire, and is also a student of literature.
      She also is said to have been the first to establish a female
      quartet in America.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest American lady violinist to gain honours abroad is Miss
      Leonora Jackson, who won the Mendelssohn state prize at Berlin,
      in 1898, and who has gained a great reputation by her
      performances before the most important musical organisations in
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Jackson was fortunate enough to attract the attention of
      Mrs. Grover Cleveland, who admired her talent, and, with Mr.
      George Vanderbilt, sent her abroad. For two years she studied in
      Paris, and then went to Berlin, where she became a pupil of
      Joachim. In Berlin she made her début in 1896, with the
      Philharmonic Orchestra, which was conducted by Joachim on
      that<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id=
      "page343"></a>{343}</span> occasion. Shortly afterwards she was
      commanded by the Empress of Germany to play at the Royal Opera
      House, in Berlin, and she soon earned for herself a position
      amongst the best of the rising violinists of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she appeared in London, in 1898, she surprised and delighted
      the audience, displaying a fine tone, natural musical feeling,
      and complete technique. Few violinists can play with such quiet,
      intense sentiment. Miss Jackson, though but twenty years of age,
      is already a veteran concert player, for she has appeared in many
      cities of Europe, and was already known in America before she
      went to Berlin. She played in July, 1899, before the Queen of
      England at Windsor Castle, and again in August at Osborne House,
      in the Isle of Wight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time has long since gone by when mere showy technique would
      earn a reputation for any violinist, male or female,
      and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id=
      "page344"></a>{344}</span> she who expects to be numbered with
      the great violinists must be first of all a musician, capable of
      interpreting the greatest works. If in addition to this she has
      "the divine spark," she will be truly great.

    <p>
      FAMOUS QUARTETS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quartet playing is at once the delight and the despair of the
      amateur, who finds no greater pleasure than an evening spent in
      endeavouring to unravel the intricacies of chamber music, nor any
      keener disappointment than the realisation that it is capable of
      far better interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the professional there are many influences which cause him to
      hesitate before he launches forth upon the quicksands of public
      performance. The first necessity in professional quartet playing
      is the devotion of a large amount of time to the acquisition of a
      perfect ensemble. A quartet may be likened<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>{346}</span> unto a
      family, in which the members learn to know one another by being
      brought up together, and few are the professionals who can
      sacrifice the time necessary for the acquisition of this perfect
      ensemble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently very little was done previous to the nineteenth
      century in the way of quartet concerts, but Baillot founded a
      series of quartet concerts in Paris, which were highly spoken of,
      and about the same time Schuppanzigh, an excellent violinist and
      teacher in Vienna, established a quartet which became famous. In
      this quartet Mayseder played, in his younger days, second violin.
      Mayseder was considered the foremost violinist in Vienna, but he
      never travelled as a virtuoso.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Spohr went first to Leipzig and was unknown, he had to find
      a way by which he could attract attention to himself,&mdash;in
      those days the advertising agent was not much in
      evidence,&mdash;so that he might give a concert with a reasonable
      prospect of success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347" id=
      "page347"></a>{347}</span> The rich merchants, to whom he had
      brought letters of introduction, knew nothing of him and received
      him coldly. "I was very anxious to be invited to play at one of
      their music parties in order to draw attention to myself," Spohr
      says in his autobiography, "and my wish was fulfilled, for I was
      invited to a grand party and asked to play something. I chose one
      of the loveliest of the six new quartets of Beethoven, with which
      I had often charmed my hearers in Brunswick. But after a few bars
      I already noticed that my accompanists knew not the music and
      were quite incapable of playing it. This disturbed me, and my
      dismay increased when I observed that the assembled company paid
      little attention to my playing. Conversation became general, and
      ultimately so loud as almost to drown the music. I rose in the
      midst of the music, hurried to my violin case without saying a
      word, and was on the point of putting my instrument
      away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348" id=
      "page348"></a>{348}</span> This made quite a sensation in the
      company, and the host approached me questioningly. I met him with
      the remark,&mdash;which could be heard everywhere,&mdash;'I have
      always been accustomed to be listened to with attention. As it
      has been otherwise here, I thought the company would prefer that
      I should stop.' The host did not know at first how to reply, and
      retired somewhat discomfited. As I made preparations for leaving,
      after having excused myself to the other musicians, the host came
      up and said, quite amicably: 'If you could but play something
      else, something more suitable to the taste and capacity of the
      company, you would find them an attentive and grateful audience.'
      It was clear to me before that I had chosen the wrong music in
      the first instance for such a company, and I was glad enough now
      to have an opportunity to change it. So I took up my violin again
      and played Rode's E flat quartet, which the musicians already
      knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="page349" id=
      "page349"></a>{349}</span> and accompanied well enough. This time
      there was perfect silence, and the enthusiasm for my playing
      increased with each movement. At the end of the quartet so much
      flattery was heaped upon me that I trotted out my
      hobby-horse,&mdash;the G variations of Rode. With this piece I
      made quite a sensation, and for the remainder of the evening I
      was the object of the most flattering attention."
    </p>
    <p>
      This little episode shows that Beethoven was not fully
      appreciated, and it also shows that quartet playing was regarded
      at that time in an entirely different light from that in which we
      are accustomed to think of it to-day. We do not consider the
      first violinist a soloist and the rest merely his accompaniment,
      but each member of the quartet is practically of equal
      importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lambert Joseph Massart, the eminent teacher of Paris, is said to
      have been an excellent quartet player, and often, with
      his<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350" id=
      "page350"></a>{350}</span> wife, an admirable pianist, he gave
      delightful chamber concerts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few violinists have been more closely associated with quartet
      playing than Ferdinand David, in his way one of the most
      celebrated violinists. Little is known of his early youth except
      that he was born at Hamburg in 1810, and was there at the time of
      the French occupation. It has been said that he played in a
      concert at ten years of age and at thirteen became a pupil of
      Spohr at Cassel. He made a concert tour with his sister, Madame
      Dulcken, and in 1827 entered the orchestra of the Königstadt
      Theatre at Berlin. Here he became acquainted with Mendelssohn,
      with whom he was from that time on terms of the greatest
      intimacy. While in Berlin he was heard by a wealthy musical
      amateur named Liphart, who lived at Dorpat, and who maintained a
      private quartet. He engaged David, who eventually married his
      daughter, to lead this quartet, and for several<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page351" id="page351"></a>{351}</span> years
      the young violinist remained in Dorpat, though he found
      opportunity to make some concert tours through the north of
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mendelssohn was appointed conductor of the Gewandhaus
      concerts at Leipzig, he sent for David and made him concert
      master, which post he occupied from 1836. Seven years later the
      conservatory was founded by Mendelssohn, and David became
      professor of violin, in which position his influence became great
      and beneficial.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Leipzig David established a quartet, which was one of the
      best, if not the very best, in its day, though it may have been
      surpassed later by the Florentine Quartet and those of Joachim,
      in London and Berlin, and possibly by Brodsky's later Leipzig
      quartet.
    </p>
    <p>
      David died in 1873, beloved and respected, and will be remembered
      as one of the most refined musicians and admirable teachers of
      the century.

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id=
      "page352"></a>{352}</span> Josef Hellmesberger, one of the most
      brilliant violinists and noted teachers of Vienna, founded, in
      1849, a quartet which achieved an immense reputation. His
      associates were Heissler, Durst, and Schlesinger. Hellmesberger
      made a point of finding works of merit which had sunk into
      oblivion, but which were worthy of a hearing. Hellmesberger spent
      the whole of his life in Vienna, with the exception of a tour in
      1847, and he held the highest musical office in the Austrian
      Empire, that of director of the Imperial Band.
    </p>
    <p>
      A story which is told of him bears testimony to his remarkable
      musical instinct. Teresa Milanollo, in 1840, took a new
      manuscript by De Bériot to Vienna. She wished to keep it for her
      own use, and did not show it to anybody. Hellmesberger heard it
      played at two rehearsals, and then went home and wrote out the
      whole work from memory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353"
      id="page353"></a>{353}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      No small portion of the immense influence which Joachim has
      wielded in the musical world has been directed toward quartet
      playing, and he has established a quartet in London and another
      one at Berlin, which both bear an enviable reputation. His
      chamber music classes, too, at the Berlin High School, tend to
      develop admirable quartet players; thus we find Marie Soldat
      organising a ladies' quartet which had a good career, and
      Gabrielle Wietrowitz taking the place of first violin in the
      excellent ladies' quartet formed in England by Miss Emily
      Shinner.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href=
      "#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Miss Shinner, whose
      efforts in the artistic world have been of great value, and whose
      quartet has an immense reputation in England, was also a pupil of
      Joachim.

      "page354"></a>{354}</span> who made his mark in Europe about the
      middle of the nineteenth century. Becker was travelling in Italy
      in 1865, and settled in Florence for a time, during which he
      organised the above-mentioned quartet, with Masi, second violin,
      Chiostri, viola, and Hilpert, violoncello. In Florence there
      existed a society for the performance of chamber music, which had
      been established by a wealthy professor named Bazzini, a
      violinist and composer who travelled much, and whose influence in
      Italy, in the cause of German music, was of great value. Bazzini
      was born in 1818 and died in 1897.
    </p>
    <p>
      From time to time this society gave subscription concerts, and
      Becker was invited to lead ten such concerts during the winter of
      1865-66. He consented to do so, but found the quartet in a state
      of dissolution. He brought Hilpert with him, and engaged Masi as
      second violin, Chiostro being the only member of the original
      quartet. Masi<span class="pagenum"><a name="page355" id=
      "page355"></a>{355}</span> was not accustomed to chamber music,
      but Becker took him in hand and he improved rapidly. In order to
      still enhance his value in the quartet, Becker presented him with
      a Stradivarius violin. They remained in Florence until their
      ensemble was absolutely perfect, and then began a series of tours
      which took them all over Europe. In Vienna the quartet was
      subjected to comparison with those of Hellmesberger and of
      Joachim, for the former had just given six chamber concerts, and
      the latter three. The first concert given by the Florentine
      Quartet was thinly attended, but the report of its excellence
      brought an overflowing audience to the second concert, and in all
      ten were given during the remainder of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 1875 Hilpert withdrew, and his place was filled by Hegyesi,
      who remained with the quartet until it was disbanded in 1880.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent series of quartet concerts<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page356" id="page356"></a>{356}</span> was
      founded in Stuttgart by Edmund Singer, who was appointed
      professor of violin in the Conservatorium, leader of the court
      music, and chamber musician, in 1861, after a distinguished
      career of some ten or more years as a virtuoso. These concerts
      met with triumphant success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Georg J.R. Heckmann founded a quartet at Cologne and travelled
      through Europe, but it was surpassed by the Florentine Quartet,
      and did not gain the highest reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quartet which has been pronounced to be one of the best in
      existence is that which is led by Jeno Hubay, in Pesth, and in
      which Hegyesi, formerly of the Florentine Quartet, is the
      'cellist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adolf Brodsky, who for a time resided in New York, founded a
      string quartet at Leipzig, with Hans Becker, son of the founder
      of the Florentine Quartet, Hans Sitt, and Julius Klengel, the
      'cellist, and this quartet<span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"
      id="page357"></a>{357}</span> was said to have no superior in
      Europe, and not more than one equal,&mdash;the Joachim Quartet of
      Berlin. In 1891 Brodsky went to New York, where he also
      established a quartet, but with little success. The organisation
      was received with respect, owing to Mr. Brodsky's European
      reputation, but it was admitted on all hands that superior
      organisations existed in America. Before Mr. Brodsky had time to
      bring his quartet to a high degree of proficiency, he returned to
      Europe, and, after a brief stay in Germany, accepted a position
      in England, where he has established another quartet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was succeeded in the quartet at Leipzig and at the
      conservatory by Arno Hilf, a distinguished violinist with an
      enormous technique, who was born in 1858 and was taught by David,
      Röntgen, and Schradieck.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quartet playing in public was established in England in 1835,
      when the admirers of Joseph Dando, an excellent violinist,
      opened<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358" id=
      "page358"></a>{358}</span> a subscription for the purpose of
      giving some concerts in which the chamber music, and especially
      the quartets of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Spohr, etc., should be
      performed. The first concert was given at the Horn Tavern,
      Doctors'-Commons, in London, on September 23d of that year, and
      being highly successful, a second was given on October 12th, and
      a third on the 26th, each proving more attractive than its
      predecessor. These concerts lasted for two seasons, when a new
      quartet was formed, with H.G. Blagrove and Henry Gattie as first
      and second violins, Mr. Dando, viola, and Mr. Lucas, 'cello, for
      the more perfect study and presentation of quartets and other
      chamber music. These concerts were given at the Hanover Square
      rooms, and on account of the care bestowed upon the rehearsals
      (of which they held seven or eight for each concert), they threw
      all previous performances into the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page359" id=
      "page359"></a>{359}</span> The tide of public favour had now set
      in, and other quartets were formed, but none reached such
      excellence as that headed by Blagrove, which was invited to play
      at the Philharmonic concerts, where it produced a great
      sensation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the end of the seventh season Blagrove withdrew, but the
      quartet continued in existence for many years, Mr. Dando playing
      first violin, and Mr. Loder, the viola, and the concerts were
      given at Crosby Hall in the city, instead of the Hanover Square
      rooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      At St. Petersburg a quartet was formed by Leopold Auer, an
      excellent violinist, who at the death of Wieniawski was appointed
      professor of violin at the Conservatoire. Auer was born in
      Hungary, and became a pupil of Dont at Vienna, after which he had
      a brilliant career as a virtuoso in Europe. His St. Petersburg
      quartet was founded in 1868, and became one of the leading
      musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="page360" id=
      "page360"></a>{360}</span> organisations of the Russian capital,
      until the death of Davidoff, the violoncellist, who was one of
      its members, in 1890.
    </p>
    <p>
      Auer has been very active in the musical life of St. Petersburg,
      and is very highly esteemed both as a man and as a musician,
      teacher, and performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quartet which has gained a great reputation in Europe during
      recent years is the Bohemian Quartet, consisting of Carl
      Hoffmann, first violin, Joseph Suk, second violin, Oscar Nedbal,
      viola, and Hanus Wihom, violoncello. They play with a great deal
      of vim and abandon, and the ensemble is remarkable.
    </p>
    <p>
      At Hanover Richard Sahla has established a quartet, with Meneke,
      Kugler, and Loeleberg, and Arnold Rosé's quartet, of Vienna, has
      travelled in Hungary, Italy, and other countries, gaining a good
      reputation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the United States there have been well meant efforts to found
      good quartets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361" id=
      "page361"></a>{361}</span> these have all had a beneficial
      influence. In Boston Mr. Bernhard Listemann, some twenty years
      ago, established a quartet which gave some very delightful
      concerts, but the past decade has witnessed the rise of an
      organisation which is able to bear comparison with any quartet in
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Kneisel Quartet was organised in 1885, the year in which Mr.
      Franz Kneisel accepted the position of concert-master to the
      Boston Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Henry L. Higginson invited him at
      the same time to organise a quartet, and a series of concerts was
      given that season in Chickering Hall. While the excellence of the
      quartet was apparent from the start, there were comparatively few
      people in Boston who took much interest in chamber music, and the
      audiences were, as a rule, small. Year by year they have
      increased, and for the past few years it has been necessary to
      give the concerts in Association Hall, which has a<span class=
      "pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>{362}</span> seating
      capacity about twice as large as that of the original hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second violin is Mr. Otto Roth,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
      "FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
      "fnanchor">[2]</a> a native of Vienna, who played for three years
      under the baton of Hans Richter, and came to Boston to play first
      violin in the Symphony Orchestra.
    </p>
    <div class="footnote">

        <a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href=

        retired from the quartet in 1899 and his place was filled by
        Mr. Karl Ondricek.

      Mr. Louis Svecenski, an excellent artist, who studied in the
      Vienna Conservatory, under Hellmesberger and Grün, plays the
      viola, and the 'cellist is Alwyn Schroeder, an artist, who had
      achieved a high reputation as a 'cello virtuoso, before he came
      to America.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a few years the Kneisel Quartet began to appear in other
      cities, and now gives regular series of subscription concerts in
      New York, Washington, Baltimore, Hartford, and Worcester, also
      Harvard, Yale, and Princeton Universities, besides
      occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363" id=
      "page363"></a>{363}</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      performances in more remote cities. In 1896 the quartet had given
      over eight hundred concerts since its formation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the Symphony season in Boston, in 1896, the Kneisel
      Quartet made a visit to London and gave several concerts. In
      London it was obliged to stand comparison with the finest
      quartets in existence. The Joachim Quartet and the Bohemian
      Quartet gave concerts the same season, but the unanimous verdict
      was to the effect that none could equal the Kneisel Quartet in
      absolute ensemble and perfection of detail. While the Bohemian
      Quartet played with a great deal of abandon and enthusiasm, and
      the Joachim Quartet contained players of a greater reputation in
      Europe, yet the Kneisel Quartet simply confirmed the reputation
      it had acquired in America. "It would, indeed, be impossible to
      conceive greater perfection in the matter of ensemble, precision,
      delicacy, and all the qual<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364"
      id="page364"></a>{364}</span> ities requisite for the proper
      interpretation of chamber music."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spring of 1899 the Kneisel Quartet made an extended tour
      in America, and found the musical condition of the great cities
      in the United States, as evidenced by the appreciation of music,
      fully equal to that of the European centres. Brahms and Beethoven
      were played in Denver and in San Francisco to audiences who were
      fully equal to the enjoyment of the highest class of music, and
      everywhere the quartet was greeted with enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The success of the Kneisel Quartet is due to the long and arduous
      practice which the members have enjoyed together, for perfection
      in quartet playing is only possible through long association.
    </p>
    <p>
      While virtuosity is not essential for quartet playing, good
      musicianship is very necessary. Patient and self-denying practice
      are absolute requisites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page365" id=
      "page365"></a>{365}</span> The love of chamber music is
      apparently growing in the United States, for in many of the large
      cities quartets have been established by good musicians, and the
      opportunities for hearing fine interpretations of the best
      chamber music are increasing each year. It is a branch of musical
      art which appeals only to cultivated taste, for it is necessarily
      free from sensationalism and individual display. Therefore, the
      love of quartet playing may be considered to be a true index of
      the growth of musical culture.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
